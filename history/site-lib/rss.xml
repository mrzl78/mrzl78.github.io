This is the Law Code of Hammurabi. Hammurabi the Great was the all-powerful king of the ancient empire of Babylonia. In about 2100 BC, Hammurabi ordered all the laws of his empire to be written down.
One reason for Hammurabi’s decision was that, as the population grew and different peoples settled in his empire, there were conflicting customs and practices. A single code of law would solve some of these problems. Also, some of the old customs had become outdated, so new laws were needed. In all, 282 laws were carved onto a 2.4-metre-high column of diorite.”<a data-footref="[inline0" href="#fn-1-b8b4b0bd5ff9375f" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a><br>Codex Hammurabi

Unteruhldingen, Lake Constance, Germany. Reconstruction.
The so-called lake dwellings (Uferrandsiedlungen), or stilt houses (Pfahlbauten), are still to be located all along the arch of the Alps. They form a network, connecting parts of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Lake dwellings were built at the shores of lakes, using oak or ash stems that were rammed into the moist or wet ground. These stilts were found in the 19th century and the thesis was that the bronze age people who built them had rammed the stilts into the lake bed and then platforms were built onto the lake. This thesis cannot be fully supported by later finds. For instance, there were many stilts rammed into the ground one by the other, but they turned out not to be from the same time. This suggests that replacements had to be made time and again, probably because ate the place where the stilt came out of the ground and into contact with the air, it would rot relatively quickly, while the part in the ground which was sealed off from oxygen stayed intact. Of course, high waters would still have flooded the area of the houses.

First in the Tigris-Euphrates and Nile River valleys, then the Indus valley, and later in China’s Huang River (Huang He) valley and a few other regions, societies emerged that were far larger and denser than the farming communities of the Neolithic period. We refer to these big concentrations of people as complex societies, or, more traditionally, as civilisations.
Their most noticeable characteristic was cities. Early cities were centres of power, manufacturing, and creativity. Building and preserving them, however, required drastic alteration
s of the local environment to produce sufficient food, building materials, and sources of energy. The price of this intervention was high. Dense urban societies were extremely vulnerable to changes in weather, climate, disease conditions, wood supplies, and trade links to distant regions. After the appearance of complex societies, humans stepped up their efforts to manipulate and control their physical and natural environment. This had great benefits but also produced a negative feedback cycle.Dates

The intensification of population and production obliged humans to experiment with new forms of social organization. The customs and rules that governed social relationships in a foraging band of twentyfive or thirty people were no longer adequate.<br>After about 4000 BC, massive changes occur in social customs and institutions. The complex societies that arose in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Indus valleys, and somewhat later in other regions, were cauldrons<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> of intensification. That is, people lived and worked together in much larger, denser communities than had ever existed. These societies shared a number of fundamental characteristics, which we generally associate with civilizations:
Cities arose, the early ones varying somewhat in their forms and functions. By 2250 BC, there were about eight cities in the world that had 30 000 or more inhabitants. By 1200 BC there were about sixteen cities that big.
<br>Some people took up full-time specialized occupations and professions (artisans<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-2-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a>, merchants<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-3-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>, soldiers, priests, and so on) rather than spending most of their time collecting, producing, or processing food.
A hierarchy of social classes (social stratification) appeared in which some men and women – the elite class – had more wealth, power, and privilege than did others. Also, men became dominant over women in political and social life, leading to patriarchy.
The state, that is, a centralized system of government and command, was invented. This meant that a minority group – kings, queens, high officials, priests, generals – exercised control over the labour and social behaviour of everyone else.
Complex exchanges of food and other products took place within the complex society, and lines of trade connected the society to neighbours near and far.
Technological innovations multiplied, and each new useful invention tended to suggest several others.
Monumental building took place – city walls, temples, palaces, public plazas, and tombs of rulers.
A system of writing, or at least a complex method of record-keeping, came into use.
Spiritual belief systems, public laws, and artistic expressions all became richer and more complex.
Creative individuals collaborated with the ruling class to lay the foundations of astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry, as well as civil engineering and architecture.

<br>A society did not have to have every one of these characteristics to qualify as a civilization. The checklist is less important than the fact that all these social, cultural, economic, and political elements interacted dynamically with one another. The synergism<a data-footref="4" href="#fn-4-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a> among them made the society complex, that is, made it recognizable as a civilization.World population started growing at a faster rate than ever before. The size and density of communities expanded, and networks of communication by land and sea became more extensive and sophisticated. Along with these developments came, as we might well expect, an intensification in the flow of information and a general speed-up in the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds.<br>
One example is religious knowledge. In the early millennia of this period certain ideas, practices, and artistic expressions centred on the worship of female deities<a data-footref="5" href="#fn-5-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[5]</a> spread widely along routes of trade and migration to embrace a large part of western Eurasia. Another example is the idea and technology of writing, which emerged first, as far as we know, in either Egypt or Mesopotamia and spread widely from there to the eastern Mediterranean and India. A third example is the horse-drawn chariot, which may have first appeared in the Inner Eurasian steppes and within less than a thousand years spread all across Eurasia from western Europe to China.<br>There were numerous scientific, technological, and cultural innovations that complex societies achieved. To take just one early example, the city-dwellers of Sumer in southern Mesopotamia, which is as far as we know the earliest urban civilization, made fundamental scientific and technical breakthroughs in the fourth and third millennia BC. Sometime before 3000 BC, Sumerian scribes worked out a system of numerical notation in the writing script they used, called cuneiform. They used a combination of base-ten and base-sixty mathematics, together with a growing understanding of geometry, for everyday government and commerce, as well as to survey land, chart the stars, design buildings, and build irrigation<a data-footref="6" href="#fn-6-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[6]</a> works. Other technical innovations included the seed drill (a sowing device), the vaulted arch, refinements in bronze metallurgy, and, most ingenious of all, the wheel. This concept was probably first applied to pottery making, later to transport and ploughing.<br>Within complex societies, such as those that emerged in the great river valleys, the interchange of information and ideas tended to be so intense that each society developed a distinct cultural style. We can tell apart these distinctive styles today in the surviving remnants<a data-footref="7" href="#fn-7-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[7]</a> of buildings, art objects, written texts, tools, and other material remains.
We should, however, keep two ideas in mind. One is that all complex societies were invariably changing, rather than possessing timeless, static cultural traits. The style of a civilization changed from one generation to the next because cultural expressions and values were invariably bound up with the natural environment, economic life, and politics, which were continuously changing as well. The second point is that early civilizations were not culturally self-contained. All of them developed and changed as they did partly because of their connections to other societies near and far, connections that played themselves out in trade, migration, war, and cultural exchange. |<br><img src="https://www.worldhistory.org/img/r/p/1500x1500/17844.png.webp?v=1737009437-1695055322" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">population growthenvironmental degradationfood shortagesSocial and economic innovation to control the environment and increase the productivitymore agricultural productivityDemographic, economic, or political collapse (e.g., Sumerian, Indus Valley, Mayan civilisations)degraded disease environmentincreased social conflict Recompile <br>cauldron: a huge pot to cook; here figuratively for regions of intense development.<a href="#fnref-1-0f9fb99279b48ac3" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>

Scholars generally agree that foragers (hunter-gatherers) of the Paleolithic enjoyed, at least much of the time, sufficient food supplies, adequate shelter, and shorter daily working hours than most adults do today. Humans did not, therefore, consciously take up crop growing and animal raising because they thought they would have a more secure and satisfying life. In other words, humans seem to have been “pushed” into agriculture rather than “pulled” into it.<br>The coming of agrarian societies was almost certainly connected to the waning<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-51dea28f1a8274f6" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> of the Pleistocene, or Ice Age, that is, the period, beginning about 15 000 years ago, when glaciers shrank and both sea levels and global temperatures rose. In several parts of the Northern Hemisphere rainfall increased significantly. Rising seas drowned low-lying coastal shelves as well as land bridges that had previously connected regions separated by water today. Land bridges now under water included spans between Siberia and Alaska, Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Britain and continental Europe.<br>
One consequence of the great thaw was that across much of the Northern Hemisphere warmer, rainier, ice-free conditions permitted forests, meadowlands<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-2-51dea28f1a8274f6" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a>, and small animal populations to flourish. The natural bounty was so great in some localities that human bands began to settle in one place all or part of the year to forage and hunt. That is, they became sedentary, settled in hamlets or villages rather than moving from camp to camp. For example, in the relatively well-watered part of the Middle East we call the Fertile Crescent, groups began sometime between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago to found tiny settlements in order to collect plentiful stands of wild grain and other edible plants and animals.<br>The Fertile Crescent
<img alt="Fertile Crescent" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/50/64950-050-7FF76F71/cities-records-rivers-mouths-Euphrates-Tigris-countries.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">
<br>In time, these groups learned how to control and manipulate the reproduction of plants that were bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and easier to grow, harvest, store, and cook than were wild food plants. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies > Animal Domestication and its Effects" data-href="I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies#Animal Domestication and its Effects" href="102-neolithicization/i-farming-and-the-emergence-of-complex-societies.html#Animal Domestication and its Effects" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Systematic domestication</a> was under way!
In the Fertile Crescent key domesticates included the ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, and several other edible plants. Selecting and breeding particular animal species – sheep, goats, cattle, pigs – that were good to eat and easy to manage occurred in a similar way. In effect, humans started grooming the natural environment to reduce the organisms they did not want (weeds, predatory wolves) and to increase the number of organisms they did want (grains, legumes, wool-bearing sheep, hunting dogs).The intensification in population densities and economic productivity that farming permitted also led humans to intervene in the natural and physical environment as never before. As farmers cleared more land, planted more crops, and pastured more animals, they enhanced their species’ biological success. That is, there occurred a positive feedback cycle of ever-increasing population and productivity.
Beginning about 6000 BC, this intensification in particular parts of the world moved to a level that required radical innovations in the way humans lived and worked. |<br>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/4_Seasons_Roots.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">
Comparison of the root systems of Perennial Wheatgrass and Annual Wheat. This difference is important e.g. in the midwest of the USA, where the perennial wheatgrass was predominant and only replaced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. → what do you think consequences might be for soil and landscape after farmers started planting annual wheat instead of the perennial wheatgrass?
Explain the difference between the two sorts of wheat illustrated above and try to think about consequences
perennial wheatgrass: doesn’t die after the season; hibernates → massive roots
annual wheat: dies after season; seeds off
annual grasses: had bigger seeds → bigger yield
→ loss of root systems: more erosion, wind and water cary away most important top soil strati; flash floods, dust storms

The first timelines appeared in the time of enlightenment, when scholars started to assemble vast amounts of data and felt a strong need to organise and order this data.How do we define that something is “antique” or “medieval”?
→ Time frames: Periods
How could periods be defined?
Definition: A period is a stretch of time with relatively stable characteristics in arts and architecture, material use, human lifestyle, political systems, etc.

<br>Perennial Wheatgrass vs. Annual Wheat
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/4_Seasons_Roots.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">
Comparison of the root systems of Perennial Wheatgrass and Annual Wheat. This difference is important e.g. in the midwest of the USA, where the perennial wheatgrass was predominant and only replaced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. → what do you think consequences might be for soil and landscape after farmers started planting annual wheat instead of the perennial wheatgrass?
Explain the difference between the two sorts of wheat illustrated above and try to think about consequences
perennial wheatgrass: doesn’t die after the season; hibernates → massive roots
annual wheat: dies after season; seeds off
annual grasses: had bigger seeds → bigger yield
→ loss of root systems: more erosion, wind and water cary away most important top soil strati; flash floods, dust storms

Maize/corn becomes most important staple food in South America
Scholars generally agree that foragers (hunter-gatherers) of the Paleolithic enjoyed, at least much of the time, sufficient food supplies, adequate shelter, and shorter daily working hours than most adults do today. Humans did not, therefore, consciously take up crop growing and animal raising because they thought they would have a more secure and satisfying life. In other words, humans seem to have been “pushed” into agriculture rather than “pulled” into it.The coming of agrarian societies was almost certainly connected to the waning of the Pleistocene, or Ice Age, that is, the period, beginning about 15 000 years ago, when glaciers shrank and both sea levels and global temperatures rose. In several parts of the Northern Hemisphere rainfall increased significantly. Rising seas drowned low-lying coastal shelves as well as land bridges that had previously connected regions separated by water today. Land bridges now under water included spans between Siberia and Alaska, Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Britain and continental Europe.
One consequence of the great thaw was that across much of the Northern Hemisphere warmer, rainier, ice-free conditions permitted forests, meadowlands, and small animal populations to flourish. The natural bounty was so great in some localities that human bands began to settle in one place all or part of the year to forage and hunt. That is, they became sedentary, settled in hamlets or villages rather than moving from camp to camp. For example, in the relatively well-watered part of the Middle East we call the Fertile Crescent, groups began sometime between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago to found tiny settlements in order to collect plentiful stands of wild grain and other edible plants and animals.<br>The Fertile Crescent

<br>In time, these groups learned how to control and manipulate the reproduction of plants that were bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and easier to grow, harvest, store, and cook than were wild food plants. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="I.

In the Fertile Crescent key domesticates included the ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, and several other edible plants. Selecting and breeding particular animal species – sheep, goats, cattle, pigs – that were good to eat and easy to manage occurred in a similar way. In effect, humans started grooming the natural environment to reduce the organisms they did not want (weeds, predatory wolves) and to increase the number of organisms they did want (grains, legumes, wool-bearing sheep, hunting dogs).The intensification in population densities and economic productivity that farming permitted also led humans to intervene in the natural and physical environment as never before. As farmers cleared more land, planted more crops, and pastured more animals, they enhanced their species’ biological success. That is, there occurred a positive feedback cycle of ever-increasing population and productivity.
Beginning about 6000 BC, this intensification in particular parts of the world moved to a level that required radical innovations in the way humans lived and worked. |<br>

First in the Tigris-Euphrates and Nile River valleys, then the Indus valley, and later in China’s Huang River (Huang He) valley and a few other regions, societies emerged that were far larger and denser than the farming communities of the Neolithic period. We refer to these big concentrations of people as complex societies, or, more traditionally, as civilisations.
Their most noticeable characteristic was cities. Early cities were centres of power, manufacturing, and creativity. Building and preserving them, however, required drastic alteration
s of the local environment to produce sufficient food, building materials, and sources of energy. The price of this intervention was high. Dense urban societies were extremely vulnerable to changes in weather, climate, disease conditions, wood supplies, and trade links to distant regions. After the appearance of complex societies, humans stepped up their efforts to manipulate and control their physical and natural environment. This had great benefits but also produced a negative feedback cycle.Dates

The intensification of population and production obliged humans to experiment with new forms of social organization. The customs and rules that governed social relationships in a foraging band of twentyfive or thirty people were no longer adequate.After about 4000 BC, massive changes occur in social customs and institutions. The complex societies that arose in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Indus valleys, and somewhat later in other regions, were cauldrons of intensification. That is, people lived and worked together in much larger, denser communities than had ever existed. These societies shared a number of fundamental characteristics, which we generally associate with civilizations:
Cities arose, the early ones varying somewhat in their forms and functions. By 2250 BC, there were about eight cities in the world that had 30 000 or more inhabitants. By 1200 BC there were about sixteen cities that big.
Some people took up full-time specialized occupations and professions (artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests, and so on) rather than spending most of their time collecting, producing, or processing food.
A hierarchy of social classes (social stratification) appeared in which some men and women – the elite class – had more wealth, power, and privilege than did others. Also, men became dominant over women in political and social life, leading to patriarchy.
The state, that is, a centralized system of government and command, was invented. This meant that a minority group – kings, queens, high officials, priests, generals – exercised control over the labour and social behaviour of everyone else.
Complex exchanges of food and other products took place within the complex society, and lines of trade connected the society to neighbours near and far.
Technological innovations multiplied, and each new useful invention tended to suggest several others.
Monumental building took place – city walls, temples, palaces, public plazas, and tombs of rulers.
A system of writing, or at least a complex method of record-keeping, came into use.
Spiritual belief systems, public laws, and artistic expressions all became richer and more complex.
<br>Creative individuals collaborated with the ruling class to lay the foundations of astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry, as well as civil engineering and architecture.

Egypt becomes a Roman province A society did not have to have every one of these characteristics to qualify as a civilization. The checklist is less important than the fact that all these social, cultural, economic, and political elements interacted dynamically with one another. The synergism among them made the society complex, that is, made it recognizable as a civilization.World population started growing at a faster rate than ever before. The size and density of communities expanded, and networks of communication by land and sea became more extensive and sophisticated. Along with these developments came, as we might well expect, an intensification in the flow of information and a general speed-up in the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds.
One example is religious knowledge. In the early millennia of this period certain ideas, practices, and artistic expressions centred on the worship of female deities spread widely along routes of trade and migration to embrace a large part of western Eurasia. Another example is the idea and technology of writing, which emerged first, as far as we know, in either Egypt or Mesopotamia and spread widely from there to the eastern Mediterranean and India. A third example is the horse-drawn chariot, which may have first appeared in the Inner Eurasian steppes and within less than a thousand years spread all across Eurasia from western Europe to China.There were numerous scientific, technological, and cultural innovations that complex societies achieved. To take just one early example, the city-dwellers of Sumer in southern Mesopotamia, which is as far as we know the earliest urban civilization, made fundamental scientific and technical breakthroughs in the fourth and third millennia BC. Sometime before 3000 BC, Sumerian scribes worked out a system of numerical notation in the writing script they used, called cuneiform. They used a combination of base-ten and base-sixty mathematics, together with a growing understanding of geometry, for everyday government and commerce, as well as to survey land, chart the stars, design buildings, and build irrigation works. Other technical innovations included the seed drill (a sowing device), the vaulted arch, refinements in bronze metallurgy, and, most ingenious of all, the wheel. This concept was probably first applied to pottery making, later to transport and ploughing.Within complex societies, such as those that emerged in the great river valleys, the interchange of information and ideas tended to be so intense that each society developed a distinct cultural style. We can tell apart these distinctive styles today in the surviving remnants of buildings, art objects, written texts, tools, and other material remains.
We should, however, keep two ideas in mind. One is that all complex societies were invariably changing, rather than possessing timeless, static cultural traits. The style of a civilization changed from one generation to the next because cultural expressions and values were invariably bound up with the natural environment, economic life, and politics, which were continuously changing as well. The second point is that early civilizations were not culturally self-contained. All of them developed and changed as they did partly because of their connections to other societies near and far, connections that played themselves out in trade, migration, war, and cultural exchange. |<br><img src="https://www.worldhistory.org/img/r/p/1500x1500/17844.png.webp?v=1737009437-1695055322" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">Well watered farmlandsBirth of agricultureDomest. of animalsSemi-arid grasslandscoexistenceSettled farmersNomadic herdersPeaceful trade and service in civilized armies → Nomads learn their military techniquescivilisation usually wins until weakened by natural or human factors (e.g., poor leadership)Peaceful trade and service in civilized armies → Nomads learn about &amp; envy civilized wealthcivilisations adapted to infectious diseases but nomads haven'tclashIndian civilisation spreads across South &amp; Sout-East AsiaMesopotamic civilisation spreads to Middle East and GreeceGreek civilisation spreads to Rome and MacedonRoman civilizaztion spreads to Western EuropeChinese civilisation spreads across East and South-East AsiaNOMADS:• Meat → Bigger and stronger• More mobile → Hard to catch• Size &amp; speed → Psychological edgecivilisation:• Agr. → Bigger population and army• More org. &amp; disciplined army• Usually better equip. &amp; tech.Sometimes peaceful co-existence, but often clashes with each side having its own advantages1civilisation revives and expands → Clashes with new nomadic tribescivilisation falls and continues to decline because nomads can't or won't maintain itcivilisation starts to revive for several reasons:Further weakens civilizizationsNomadic hit-and-run raids- Nomads get attached to civilized comforts- Nomads marry civ. women who raise the children- Nomads learn to appreciate &amp; maintain civ.

Maize/corn becomes most important staple food in South America
Scholars generally agree that foragers (hunter-gatherers) of the Paleolithic enjoyed, at least much of the time, sufficient food supplies, adequate shelter, and shorter daily working hours than most adults do today. Humans did not, therefore, consciously take up crop growing and animal raising because they thought they would have a more secure and satisfying life. In other words, humans seem to have been “pushed” into agriculture rather than “pulled” into it.The coming of agrarian societies was almost certainly connected to the waning of the Pleistocene, or Ice Age, that is, the period, beginning about 15 000 years ago, when glaciers shrank and both sea levels and global temperatures rose. In several parts of the Northern Hemisphere rainfall increased significantly. Rising seas drowned low-lying coastal shelves as well as land bridges that had previously connected regions separated by water today. Land bridges now under water included spans between Siberia and Alaska, Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Britain and continental Europe.
One consequence of the great thaw was that across much of the Northern Hemisphere warmer, rainier, ice-free conditions permitted forests, meadowlands, and small animal populations to flourish. The natural bounty was so great in some localities that human bands began to settle in one place all or part of the year to forage and hunt. That is, they became sedentary, settled in hamlets or villages rather than moving from camp to camp. For example, in the relatively well-watered part of the Middle East we call the Fertile Crescent, groups began sometime between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago to found tiny settlements in order to collect plentiful stands of wild grain and other edible plants and animals.The Fertile Crescent

<br>In time, these groups learned how to control and manipulate the reproduction of plants that were bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and easier to grow, harvest, store, and cook than were wild food plants. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="I. Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies > Animal Domestication and its Effects" data-href="I. Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies#Animal Domestication and its Effects" href="102-early-civilisations/i.-farming-and-the-emergence-of-complex-societies.html#Animal Domestication and its Effects" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Systematic domestication</a> was under way!
In the Fertile Crescent key domesticates included the ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, and several other edible plants. Selecting and breeding particular animals species – sheep, goats, cattle, pigs – that were good to eat and easy to manage occurred in a similar way. In effect, humans started grooming the natural environment to reduce the organisms they did not want (weeds, predatory wolves) and to increase the number of organisms they did want (grains, legumes, wool-bearing sheep, hunting dogs).The intensification in population densities and economic productivity that farming permitted also led humans to intervene in the natural and physical environment as never before. As farmers cleared more land, planted more crops, and pastured more animals, they enhanced their species’ biological success. That is, there occurred a positive feedback cycle of ever-increasing population and productivity.
Beginning about 6000 BC, this intensification in particular parts of the world moved to a level that required radical innovations in the way humans lived and worked.First in the Tigris-Euphrates and Nile River valleys, then the Indus valley, and later in China’s Huang River (Huang He) valley and a few other regions, societies emerged that were far larger and denser than the farming communities of the Neolithic period. We refer to these big concentrations of people as complex societies, or, more traditionally, as civilisations.
Their most noticeable characteristic was cities. Early cities were centres of power, manufacturing, and creativity. Building and preserving them, however, required drastic alterations of the local environment to produce sufficient food, building materials, and sources of energy. The price of this intervention was high. Dense urban societies were extremely vulnerable to changes in weather, climate, disease conditions, wood supplies, and trade links to distant regions. After the appearance of complex societies, humans stepped up their efforts to manipulate and control their physical and natural environment. This had great benefits but also produced a negative feedback cycle.Timeline

The intensification of population and production obliged humans to experiment with new forms of social organization. The customs and rules that governed social relationships in a foraging band of twentyfive or thirty people were no longer adequate.After about 4000 BC, massive changes occur in social customs and institutions. The complex societies that arose in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Indus valleys, and somewhat later in other regions, were cauldrons of intensification. That is, people lived and worked together in much larger, denser communities than had ever existed. These societies shared a number of fundamental characteristics, which we generally associate with civilizations:
Cities arose, the early ones varying somewhat in their forms and functions. By 2250 BC, there were about eight cities in the world that had 30 000 or more inhabitants. By 1200 BC there were about sixteen cities that big.
Some people took up full-time specialized occupations and professions (artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests, and so on) rather than spending most of their time collecting, producing, or processing food.
A hierarchy of social classes (social stratification) appeared in which some men and women – the elite class – had more wealth, power, and privilege than did others. Also, men became dominant over women in political and social life, leading to patriarchy.
The state, that is, a centralized system of government and command, was invented. This meant that a minority group – kings, queens, high officials, priests, generals – exercised control over the labour and social behaviour of everyone else.
Complex exchanges of food and other products took place within the complex society, and lines of trade connected the society to neighbours near and far.
Technological innovations multiplied, and each new useful invention tended to suggest several others.
Monumental building took place – city walls, temples, palaces, public plazas, and tombs of rulers.
A system of writing, or at least a complex method of record-keeping, came into use.
Spiritual belief systems, public laws, and artistic expressions all became richer and more complex.
Creative individuals collaborated with the ruling class to lay the foundations of astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry, as well as civil engineering and architecture.

Egypt becomes a Roman province A society did not have to have every one of these characteristics to qualify as a civilization. The checklist is less important than the fact that all these social, cultural, economic, and political elements interacted dynamically with one another. The synergism among them made the society complex, that is, made it recognizable as a civilization.World population started growing at a faster rate than ever before. The size and density of communities expanded, and networks of communication by land and sea became more extensive and sophisticated. Along with these developments came, as we might well expect, an intensification in the flow of information and a general speed-up in the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds.
One example is religious knowledge. In the early millennia of this period certain ideas, practices, and artistic expressions centred on the worship of female deities spread widely along routes of trade and migration to embrace a large part of western Eurasia. Another example is the idea and technology of writing, which emerged first, as far as we know, in either Egypt or Mesopotamia and spread widely from there to the eastern Mediterranean and India. A third example is the horse-drawn chariot, which may have first appeared in the Inner Eurasian steppes and within less than a thousand years spread all across Eurasia from western Europe to China.There were numerous scientific, technological, and cultural innovations that complex societies achieved. To take just one early example, the city-dwellers of Sumer in southern Mesopotamia, which is as far as we know the earliest urban civilization, made fundamental scientific and technical breakthroughs in the fourth and third millennia BC. Sometime before 3000 BC, Sumerian scribes worked out a system of numerical notation in the writing script they used, called cuneiform. They used a combination of base-ten and base-sixty mathematics, together with a growing understanding of geometry, for everyday government and commerce, as well as to survey land, chart the stars, design buildings, and build irrigation works. Other technical innovations included the seed drill (a sowing device), the vaulted arch, refinements in bronze metallurgy, and, most ingenious of all, the wheel. This concept was probably first applied to pottery making, later to transport and ploughing.Within complex societies, such as those that emerged in the great river valleys, the interchange of information and ideas tended to be so intense that each society developed a distinct cultural style. We can tell apart these distinctive styles today in the surviving remnants of buildings, art objects, written texts, tools, and other material remains.
We should, however, keep two ideas in mind. One is that all complex societies were invariably changing, rather than possessing timeless, static cultural traits. The style of a civilization changed from one generation to the next because cultural expressions and values were invariably bound up with the natural environment, economic life, and politics, which were continuously changing as well. The second point is that early civilizations were not culturally self-contained. All of them developed and changed as they did partly because of their connections to other societies near and far, connections that played themselves out in trade, migration, war, and cultural exchange. |<br>
