course by Marcel Röthlisberger, Gymnasium Lerbermatt, Switzerland.\nThis website is for internal use at Gymnasium in classes held by Marcel Röthlisberger. Sources are provided. No copyright infringement is intended.Everything that is now, is something that has become. Freely after André Holenstein: «Das Seiende als etwas Gewordenes verstehen»\nThis course runs over the 4 years of Gymnasium and provides a chronological overview of mostly Western aspects, with an open mind to international, non-European aspects, especially colonialism and decolonisation. We are Europeans based in Europe. An understanding of European culture, politics, History, society, languages and customs is essential for students who live and mature here. It is equally important, though, for all Europeans, to have a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of Europe and Europeans with the Earth and European societies’ responsibility for their actions in the past and their consequences.\nOur students are on the brink of becoming fully entitled members of our democratic society. They shall have the tools to understand dependencies, meaning of text and speech, culture and customs, political processes and possibilities. Not least, they shall understand that change is possible, necessary, and inevitable.“The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” LP Hartley, The Go-Between\nBy looking at the other, people become aware of the self. A deeper understanding of other possibilities of living a human’s life is essential. The humanities – History among them, but also literature and cultural studies – offer tools and insight into other people’s minds and living conditions. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01%20Geschichte/Spielvogel%20-%20Western%20Civilization%2010th%20ed%20Vol%202?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=9ysXKf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01 Geschichte/Spielvogel - Western Civilization 10th ed Vol 2?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=9ysXKf\" target=\"_self\">Spielvogel chapters</a> (restricted access from within the school)Text sources under public domain:<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/698\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/698\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 1</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/699\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/699\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 2</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/700\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/700\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 3</a>Marcel Röthlisberger\nGymnasium Lerbermatt\n©MMXXV","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"About the History course","level":2,"id":"About_the_History_course_0"},{"heading":"Resources","level":2,"id":"Resources_0"}],"links":["!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01%20Geschichte/Spielvogel%20-%20Western%20Civilization%2010th%20ed%20Vol%202?csf=1&web=1&e=9ysXKf"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"index.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753956249262,"modifiedTime":1760597481936,"sourceSize":2514,"sourcePath":"index.md","exportPath":"index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":85,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html":{"title":"104 Greece-End_of_Bronze_Age-Dialect_Displacement","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.jpg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html"],"createdTime":1756890243302,"modifiedTime":1756890243302,"sourceSize":438982,"sourcePath":"resources/104 Greece-End_of_Bronze_Age-Dialect_Displacement.jpg","exportPath":"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":50,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html":{"title":"104 greekdialects800bcs","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.jpg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html"],"createdTime":1756890316024,"modifiedTime":1756890316025,"sourceSize":462395,"sourcePath":"resources/104 greekdialects800bcs.jpg","exportPath":"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":52,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"100-year1/104-ancient-greece/104-i-ancient-greece-–-overview.html":{"title":"104-I - Ancient Greece – Overview","icon":"","description":"Overview text Take notes of the most important aspects mentioned in the text.\nWhy is Greek culture still relevant today?

Variations of this system spread into all kinds of regions and these simpler scripts were more widely used, if by an elite minority, though.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251028065106.png\" src=\"100-year1/104-ancient-greece/attachments/pasted-image-20251028065106.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFirst letter: Alpha, coming from “Aleph” (West Semitic word for “ox”)\nThe Greeks, who called themselves Hellenes from the 8th century onwards, did not form a homogenous political nation. They consisted of several tribes and independent city-states (poleis, singular: polis). Nonetheless, the Greeks had a shared identity. They talked the same language, albeit in different dialects, and used the same alphabet inherited from the Phoenicians, a tradespeople from the eastern Mediterranean.Apart from that, the Greeks were unified by their religious beliefs. Greek religion was polytheistic, i.e., there were several gods. Although they were immortal and enjoyed eternal youth, they had strong human features and acted like mortals. According to the Greek belief system, the gods lived on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, as a family. Their leaders were Zeus and his wife Hera. The Olympian gods (see Pantheon, below), all relatives of them, had different fields of duties: Apollo (healing, fortune-telling, poetry), Aphrodi­te (love), Artemis (hunt), Ares (war), Poseidon (the sea), Hermes (messenger of the gods, god of the travellers, merchants and thieves). In order to get the god’s help, they had to be appeased with sacrifices. These adoration ceremonies took place outside the temples. Some sanctuaries became very famous. In Olympia, Greeks from various states met since 776 BC to compete in sports in honour of Zeus. In Delphi, the Greeks consulted with the oracle of Apollo and also took part in games in his honour.Antique Pantheon <br>Art on pottery\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg/960px-Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nRunners, c. 500 BC, Louvre\nOne of the characteristics of the visual arts was their uniformity throughout the numerous city-states. Until Hellenistic times, it was mostly communities who ordered pieces of art, so they were basically made for the public and for religious purposes (e.g. the Acropolis). Along vase painters, sculptors were very skilful. In classical times they managed to create vivid, lively sculptures which they integrated into buildings (temples, effigies, palaces). The first sculptural portraits were also made by Greek sculptors.The literary and artistic achievements of the Greeks were a major influence for occidental culture. The two epics of the destruction of Troy (Iliad) and Ulysses’ Odyssey by Homer determined the Greeks’ picture of their gods and historical origins. Myths and sagas initially formed the major parts of Greek historiography, too. Then, Herodot (~485 until after 430) and Thukydides (~460 until ~400) introduced a new way of historical thinking. Both historians were keen on writing truthfully about contemporary events and on showing the roots of important events. Tragedy and comedy developed out of cultic performances in honour of the gods.Initially, Greek philosophers were learned, wise men (e.g. Pythagoras, Thales), who tried to explain the world on a rational basis using different disciplines (e.g. ethics, mathematics, physics, music, poetry). Socrates (469 – 399) opposed the sophists, for whom man was the measure of all things. He looked for a base of the universe which was objective, outside human influence. He also looked for standards for human knowledge and for moral conducts. Plato (427 – 347) wrote Socrates’ teachings down in the form of dialogues. He himself thought about the ideal political state, which ought to be in harmony with human nature and the immortality of the human soul. Plato assumed that besides the ever-changing world, there are unchangeable archetypes (original forms) of all things, which man can only grasp through his thinking: ideas. Plato’s most influential student was Aristotle (384 – 322). He collected the whole knowledge of his time, and, by putting it into a clear, disctinct order, developed significant criteria for scientific work.(Adapted from Grundwissen Geschichte, tr.

Humans did not, therefore, consciously take up crop growing and animal raising because they thought they would have a more secure and satisfying life. The coming of agrarian societies was almost certainly connected to the waning of the Pleistocene, or Ice Age, that is, the period, beginning about 15 000 years ago, when glaciers shrank and both sea levels and global temperatures rose. In several parts of the Northern Hemisphere rainfall increased significantly. Rising seas drowned low-lying coastal shelves as well as land bridges that had previously connected regions separated by water today. Land bridges now under water included spans between Siberia and Alaska, Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Britain and continental Europe.\nOne consequence of the great thaw was that across much of the Northern Hemisphere warmer, rainier, ice-free conditions permitted forests, meadowlands, and small animal populations to flourish. The natural bounty was so great in some localities that human bands began to settle in one place all or part of the year to forage and hunt. That is, they became sedentary, settled in hamlets or villages rather than moving from camp to camp. For example, in the relatively well-watered part of the Middle East we call the Fertile Crescent, groups began sometime between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago to found tiny settlements in order to collect plentiful stands of wild grain and other edible plants and animals.<br>The Fertile Crescent\n<img alt=\"Fertile Crescent\" src=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/50/64950-050-7FF76F71/cities-records-rivers-mouths-Euphrates-Tigris-countries.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\n<br>In time, these groups learned how to control and manipulate the reproduction of plants that were bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and easier to grow, harvest, store, and cook than were wild food plants. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"102-I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies > Animal Domestication and its Effects\" data-href=\"102-I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies#Animal Domestication and its Effects\" href=\"100-year1/102-neolithicization/102-i-farming-and-the-emergence-of-complex-societies.html#Animal Domestication and its Effects\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Systematic domestication</a> was under way!\nIn the Fertile Crescent key domesticates included the ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, and several other edible plants. Selecting and breeding particular animal species – sheep, goats, cattle, pigs – that were good to eat and easy to manage occurred in a similar way. In effect, humans started grooming the natural environment to reduce the organisms they did not want (weeds, predatory wolves) and to increase the number of organisms they did want (grains, legumes, wool-bearing sheep, hunting dogs).<br>The intensification in population densities and economic productivity that farming permitted also led humans to intervene in the natural and physical environment as never before.

We refer to these big concentrations of people as complex societies, or, more traditionally, as civilisations.\nTheir most noticeable characteristic was cities. Early cities were centres of power, manufacturing, and creativity. Building and preserving them, however, required drastic alterations of the local environment to produce sufficient food, building materials, and sources of energy. The price of this intervention was high. Dense urban societies were extremely vulnerable to changes in weather, climate, disease conditions, wood supplies, and trade links to distant regions. After the appearance of complex societies, humans stepped up their efforts to manipulate and control their physical and natural environment. This had great benefits but also produced a negative feedback cycle.Dates\nAmong the oldest cities are\n• Jericho (fortified ~8000)\n• Çatal Hüyük (~7000)\n•Ur (~5000)\n• Byblos (5th millennium)\n~5700\nFirst proto-urban\narchitecture in Egypt\n~5500\nNeolithical settlements with long houses in Middle Europe\n~4600\nFirst city-like settlements in the Indus valley\n~4300 to ~800 BC\nStilt house settlements in central Europe\n~3800\nCultures in China\norganized in cities\n~3300\nGlacier man “Ötzi”\n~3100 to ~2600\nStonehenge\n~3000\nSumerian city-states\n~2600 – 1800\nMohenjo-Daro in the Indus valley, systematically planned city\nThe intensification of population and production obliged humans to experiment with new forms of social organization. The customs and rules that governed social relationships in a foraging band of twentyfive or thirty people were no longer adequate.<br>After about 4000 BC, massive changes occur in social customs and institutions. The complex societies that arose in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Indus valleys, and somewhat later in other regions, were cauldrons<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> of intensification. That is, people lived and worked together in much larger, denser communities than had ever existed. These societies shared a number of fundamental characteristics, which we generally associate with civilizations:\nCities arose, the early ones varying somewhat in their forms and functions. By 2250 BC, there were about eight cities in the world that had 30 000 or more inhabitants. By 1200 BC there were about sixteen cities that big.\n<br>Some people took up full-time specialized occupations and professions (artisans<a data-footref=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, merchants<a data-footref=\"3\" href=\"#fn-3-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, soldiers, priests, and so on) rather than spending most of their time collecting, producing, or processing food.\nA hierarchy of social classes (social stratification) appeared in which some men and women – the elite class – had more wealth, power, and privilege than did others. Also, men became dominant over women in political and social life, leading to patriarchy.\nThe state, that is, a centralized system of government and command, was invented. This meant that a minority group – kings, queens, high officials, priests, generals – exercised control over the labour and social behaviour of everyone else.\nComplex exchanges of food and other products took place within the complex society, and lines of trade connected the society to neighbours near and far.\nTechnological innovations multiplied, and each new useful invention tended to suggest several others.\nMonumental building took place – city walls, temples, palaces, public plazas, and tombs of rulers.\nA system of writing, or at least a complex method of record-keeping, came into use.\nSpiritual belief systems, public laws, and artistic expressions all became richer and more complex.\nCreative individuals collaborated with the ruling class to lay the foundations of astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry, as well as civil engineering and architecture.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\" target=\"_self\">Cuneiform</a>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sales_contract_Shuruppak_Louvre_AO3766.jpg/960px-Sales_contract_Shuruppak_Louvre_AO3766.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nA contract for the sale of a field and a house, in the wedge-shaped cuneiform adapted for clay tablets, Shuruppak, c. 2600 BC\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs\" target=\"_self\">Hieroglyphs</a>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Minnakht_01.JPG/960px-Minnakht_01.JPG\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nHieroglyphs on a “stela” now kept in the Louvre, Paris, c. 1321 BC.\n<br>Dates\n(<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"03 Antiquity Timelines > Ancient Civilizations\" data-href=\"03 Antiquity Timelines#Ancient Civilizations\" href=\"002-timelines/03-antiquity-timelines.html#Ancient Civilizations\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">see as timeline</a>)\n~3000\nParallel development of cuneiform in Mesopotamia and hieroglyphs in Egypt\n~2980\nFirst unification of Upper and Lower Egypt (Old Kingdom)\n~2650 – 2190\nTime of the Pyramids\n~2650 First step pyramid by Snofru\n~2600 Cheops pyramid\n2600 – ~1425\nMinoan culture on Crete\n~1900 – 1531\nBabylonian Empire\n~1700\nCode of Hammurabi, earliest known law code\n~1600\nMycenaean Culture,\nearliest advanced civilization on mainland Europe\n~1000 – 70 BC\nKingdom of Israel (with interruptions)\n30 BC\nDeath of the last pharaoh, Cleopatra VII.\nEgypt becomes a Roman province\n<br>A society did not have to have every one of these characteristics to qualify as a civilization. The checklist is less important than the fact that all these social, cultural, economic, and political elements interacted dynamically with one another. The synergism<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> among them made the society complex, that is, made it recognizable as a civilization.World population started growing at a faster rate than ever before. The size and density of communities expanded, and networks of communication by land and sea became more extensive and sophisticated. Along with these developments came, as we might well expect, an intensification in the flow of information and a general speed-up in the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds.<br>\nOne example is religious knowledge. In the early millennia of this period certain ideas, practices, and artistic expressions centred on the worship of female deities<a data-footref=\"5\" href=\"#fn-5-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> spread widely along routes of trade and migration to embrace a large part of western Eurasia. Another example is the idea and technology of writing, which emerged first, as far as we know, in either Egypt or Mesopotamia and spread widely from there to the eastern Mediterranean and India. A third example is the horse-drawn chariot, which may have first appeared in the Inner Eurasian steppes and within less than a thousand years spread all across Eurasia from western Europe to China.<br>There were numerous scientific, technological, and cultural innovations that complex societies achieved. To take just one early example, the city-dwellers of Sumer in southern Mesopotamia, which is as far as we know the earliest urban civilization, made fundamental scientific and technical breakthroughs in the fourth and third millennia BC. Sometime before 3000 BC, Sumerian scribes worked out a system of numerical notation in the writing script they used, called cuneiform. They used a combination of base-ten and base-sixty mathematics, together with a growing understanding of geometry, for everyday government and commerce, as well as to survey land, chart the stars, design buildings, and build irrigation<a data-footref=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[6]</a> works. Other technical innovations included the seed drill (a sowing device), the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">vaulted arch</a> (in architecture), refinements in bronze metallurgy, and, most ingenious of all, the wheel. This concept was probably first applied to pottery making, later to transport and ploughing.Explain Why was there more development of ideas and technology in civilisations than before? <br>Within complex societies, such as those that emerged in the great river valleys, the interchange of information and ideas tended to be so intense that each society developed a distinct cultural style. We can tell apart these distinctive styles today in the surviving remnants<a data-footref=\"7\" href=\"#fn-7-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[7]</a> of buildings, art objects, written texts, tools, and other material remains.\nWe should, however, keep two ideas in mind. One is that all complex societies were invariably changing, rather than possessing timeless, static cultural traits. The style of a civilization changed from one generation to the next because cultural expressions and values were invariably bound up with the natural environment, economic life, and politics, which were continuously changing as well. The second point is that early civilizations were not culturally self-contained. All of them developed and changed as they did partly because of their connections to other societies near and far, connections that played themselves out in trade, migration, war, and cultural exchange. |<br><img src=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/img/r/p/1500x1500/17844.png.webp?v=1737009437-1695055322\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"> <br>Cauldron: a big pot to boil e.g. soup in.<a href=\"#fnref-1-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Someone who does skilled work with their hands.<a href=\"#fnref-2-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>People who trade in goods.<a href=\"#fnref-3-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Synergism: when two or more factors work together in a positive way.<a href=\"#fnref-4-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Gods and godesses<a href=\"#fnref-5-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Bringing water to otherwise dry land.<a href=\"#fnref-6-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Remnant: something (or a part of the original) which is left over<a href=\"#fnref-7-81197e5cc57c62a3\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Crowded Cities","level":2,"id":"Crowded_Cities_0"},{"heading":"Social Consequences","level":3,"id":"Social_Consequences_0"},{"heading":"Early complex societies","level":4,"id":"Early_complex_societies_0"},{"heading":"Ideas","level":2,"id":"Ideas_0"},{"heading":"Complex societies as centres of innovation","level":3,"id":"Complex_societies_as_centres_of_innovation_0"},{"heading":"Different cultural styles","level":3,"id":"Different_cultural_styles_0"}],"links":["002-timelines/03-antiquity-timelines.html#Ancient Civilizations"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://cdn.britannica.com/08/150008-050-D5A45539/Ziggurat-Ur.jpg","fullURL":"100-year1/103-early-civilisations/103-i-cities-and-civilisations.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755007384842,"modifiedTime":1761659465355,"sourceSize":9948,"sourcePath":"100 Year1/103 Early Civilisations/103-I - Cities and Civilisations.md","exportPath":"100-year1/103-early-civilisations/103-i-cities-and-civilisations.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":18,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"100-year1/103-early-civilisations/103-ii-illustrating-features-of-early-civilisations.html":{"title":"103-II - Illustrating Features of Early Civilisations","icon":"","description":"Info\nThe pictures you find here are all from freely available online sources.

class=\"is-unresolved\">\nUnteruhldingen, Lake Constance, Germany. Reconstruction.\nThe so-called lake dwellings (Uferrandsiedlungen), or stilt houses (Pfahlbauten), are still to be located all along the arch of the Alps. They form a network, connecting parts of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Lake dwellings were built at the shores of lakes, using oak or ash stems that were rammed into the moist or wet ground. These stilts were found in the 19th century and the thesis was that the bronze age people who built them had rammed the stilts into the lake bed and then platforms were built onto the lake. This thesis cannot be fully supported by later finds. For instance, there were many stilts rammed into the ground one by the other, but they turned out not to be from the same time. This suggests that replacements had to be made time and again, probably because at the place where the stilt came out of the ground and into contact with the air, it would rot relatively quickly, while the part in the ground which was sealed off from oxygen stayed intact. Of course, high waters would still have flooded the area of the houses.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/007857/2019-04-03/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/007857/2019-04-03/\" target=\"_self\"><em></em> this article</a>Skim on lake dwellings in the Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz.

More details on Freud and his influence there.\nSigmund Freud (1856 - 1939) had a great influence on how humans were seen. Freud was one of the founders of the medical and scientific discipline of psychology. He was the forefather of the concept of modern therapy itself and his theories, while now largely rejected by psychologists in terms of their empirical accuracy, nevertheless continue to exert tremendous influence. In historical hindsight, Freud’s importance derives from his work as a philosopher of the mind more so than as a “scientist” per se, although it was precisely his drive for his work to be respected as a true science that inspired his research and writing. One major theme present in Freud’s theories had to do with sexuality, which he believed to be of central importance to psychology. His theories largely revolved around sexual instincts and their repression, and he invented various specific concepts like the “Oedipus complex,” the idea that young boys sexually desire their mothers and fear the authority of their fathers, and “penis envy,” the claim that girls are psychologically wounded by not having male genitalia, that he claimed were fundamental to the human psyche. For all his insight, and all his clinical work with women patients, however, Freud remained convinced that women were in a sense less “evolved” than men and were biologically destined for a secondary role. He also admitted that he could not really figure out women’s motivations; he famously asserted that the question that psychology could not answer was “what does a woman want?” In the end, the irony of Freud’s take on gender and sexuality is that it simply reproduced age-old sexual stereotypes and double standards, however important his other theories were in exploring the unconscious. Despite the genuine changes occurring to gender in the society around him, Freud remained embedded in the assumption that a male and female physiology dictated separate and unequal destinies for men and women. Those destinies, however, were slowly changing. Gender roles had been transformed both economically and culturally during (and because of) the war. Some of those changes were durable. The range of jobs available to women was certainly larger than it had been before the war. Women continued to wear more comfortable and practical clothing after the war than before it, the restrictive ankle-length dress replaced by the looser, calf-length dress or skirt. Some women continued to cut their hair short, and of course women’s suffrage was finally realized (albeit with various restrictions) in most European countries and the United States over the course of the 1920s.<br>\nNo sooner had the war ended, however, that men generally did everything in their power to reverse many of the changes to gender roles it had caused. Through a combination of legal restrictions and quasi-legal practices, women were forced from traditional male jobs, prevented from enrolling in universities and medical schools, and paid significantly less than men for the same work. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"402-II - The Rise of Fascism\" data-href=\"402-II - The Rise of Fascism\" href=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fascist parties</a> were explicitly devoted to enforcing traditional gender roles, and when some countries were overtaken by fascist rule women were often forced out of the workplace. Everywhere, most men (and many women) continued to insist that women were inherently biologically inferior to men and that it was the “natural” role of men to serve as head of the household and head of the nation-state in equal measure. <br>Flappers\n<img alt=\"500px-Alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/attachments/500px-alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg\" target=\"_self\">\nActor Alice Joyce in 1926, wearing a Charleston or Flapper Dress\nThe exemplar of both the greater freedom enjoyed by women and male resentment of that freedom was the “New Woman.” A stock figure in the media of the time, the New Woman was independent, working at her own job full time and living by herself, and able to enjoy a social life that included drinking, dancing, and even the possibility of casual sex. The famous “flappers” of the 1920s, young women in the latest fashion who danced to cutting-edge American jazz and wore scandalously short, knee-length dresses, were the ultimate expression of the New Woman. While the image of the New Woman was greatly exaggerated, both in advertising and by male misogynists, there was at least a kernel of truth to the archetype. Far more women were independent by the 1920s than in the past, fashions really had changed, and thanks to halting advances in contraception, casual sexual relationships were easier to have without fear of pregnancy. It would take at least another half-century, however, for laws against sexual discrimination to come into being in most countries, and of course the struggle for cultural equality remains unfulfilled to this day. | ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalysis","level":2,"id":"Sigmund_Freud_and_Psychoanalysis_0"},{"heading":"Gender Roles","level":2,"id":"Gender_Roles_0"}],"links":["400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/attachments/500px-alicejoyce1926full_crop.html"],"createdTime":1756283193054,"modifiedTime":1761211007056,"sourceSize":5324,"sourcePath":"400 Year4/401 Interwar Period and Totalitarianism/401-VI - Interwar Society.md","exportPath":"400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":85,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vii-democratic-states.html":{"title":"401-VII - Democratic States","icon":"","description":"Combine, deduct, speculate\nWhat might be reasons why Britain, France, and the USA did not turn away from democracy? Consider the texts below, as well as the other parts of the chapter and of their history. Feel free to do research online.\nAfter World War I, Great Britain went through a period of serious economic difficulties. During the war, Britain had lost many of the markets for its industrial products, especially to the United States and Japan. The post- war decline of such staple industries as coal, steel, and textiles led to a rise in unemployment, which reached the 2 million mark in 1921. Britain soon rebounded, however, and from 1925 to 1929 experienced renewed prosperity.\nBut Britain was not immune to the effects of the Great Depression. The Labour Party, now the largest party in Britain, failed to solve the nation's economic problems and fell from power in 1931. A National Government (a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives) claimed credit for bringing Britain out of the worst stages of the depression, primarily by using the traditional policies of balanced budgets and protective tariffs. British politicians largely ignored the new ideas of a Cambridge economist, John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), who published A General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. He condemned the traditional view that in a free economy, depressions should be left to work themselves out. Instead, Keynes argued that unemployment stemmed not from overproduction but from a decline in demand and that demand could be increased by public works, financed, if necessary, through deficit spending to stimulate production. (see below, USA)After the defeat of Germany, France had become the strongest power on the European continent. Its greatest need was to rebuild the devastated areas of northern and eastern France. But no French government seemed capable of solving France's financial problems between 1921 and 1926. Like other European countries, though, France did experience a period of relative prosperity between 1926 and 1929. By 1932, France began to feel the full effects of the Great Depression, and economic instability soon had political repercussions. During a nineteen-month period in 1932 and 1933, six different cabinets were formed as France faced political chaos. Finally, in 1936, fearful that rightists intended to seize power, a coalition of leftist parties-Socialists and Radicals-formed a Popular Front government.\nAlthough the Popular Front succeeded in initiating a program for workers that established the right of collective bargaining, a forty-hour workweek, two-week paid vacations, and minimum wages, its policies failed to solve the problems of the depression. By 1938, the French were experiencing a serious decline of confidence in their political system that left them unprepared to deal with their aggressive Nazi enemy to the east. After Germany, no Western nation was more affected by the Great Depression than the United States. By the end of 1932, industrial production had fallen to 50 percent of its 1929 level. Soon there were 15 million unemployed. Under these circumstances, the Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) won the 1932 presidential election by a landslide. He and his advisers pursued a policy of active government intervention in the economy that came to be known as the New Deal. To support the nation's banks, they established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured the safety of bank deposits up to $5,000. A key feature of the New Deal was a stepped-up program of public works undertaken by new government agencies such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA), established in 1935; this agency put between 2 and 3 million people to work building bridges, roads, post offices, and airports. The Roosevelt administration was also responsible for social legislation that launched the American welfare state. In 1935, the Social Security Act created a system of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.\nThe New Deal provided some social reform measures that perhaps averted the possibility of social revolution in the United States. It did not, however, solve the unemployment problems of the Great Depression. In May 1937, during what was considered a period of full recovery, American unemployment still stood at 7 million; by the following year, it had increased to 11 million. Only World War II and the subsequent growth of armament-related industries brought American workers back to full employment.

It undermined the faith in progress that had grown, despite all of its setbacks, throughout the nineteenth century among many, perhaps most, Europeans. The major political movements of the nineteenth century, namely nationalism, liberalism, and socialism seemed to have succeeded: everywhere in Europe nations replaced empires, and Europe controlled more of the world in 1920 than it ever had or ever would again. In the aftermath of the war, almost every government in Europe, even Germany, was a republican democracy based on the rule of law. Even socialists had cause to celebrate: there was a nominally Marxist state in Russia and socialist parties were powerful and militant all across Europe. The old order of monarchs and nobles was rendered all but obsolete, with noble titles holding on as nothing more than archaic holdovers from the past in nearly every country. In addition, of course, technology continued to advance apace.Stop and exchange: define nationalism, liberalism, and socialism Despite the success of all of those movements, however, with all of the hopes and aspirations of their supporters over the last century, Europe had degenerated into a horrendous and costly war. The war had not purified and invigorated the great powers; they were all left reeling, weakened, and at a loss for how to prevent a future war. Science had advanced, but it seemed as if its most noteworthy accomplishment was the production of more effective weapons. The global empires remained, but the seeds of their dissolution were already present.The results were bitterness and reprisals. The Treaty of Versailles that ended the war imposed harsh penalties on Germany, returning Alsace and Lorraine to France and imposing a massive indemnity on the defeated country. The Treaty also required Germany to accept the war guilt clause, in which it assumed full responsibility for the war having started in the first place. Simultaneously, the Austrian Empire collapsed, with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the new Balkan nation of Yugoslavia all becoming independent countries and Austria a short-lived republic. Almost no one would have believed that another Great War would occur in twenty years.The War to End War\nthe slogan was the title of a book collecting essays by H.G. Wells. He argued that it was necessary to defeat Germany’s militarism (by waging war against the Germans) in order to sustain a lasting peace.\nIn other words, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"401-VIII - Summary Results of WWI - Seminal Catastrophe > Results of World War I\" data-href=\"401-VIII - Summary Results of WWI - Seminal Catastrophe#Results of World War I\" href=\"400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-viii-summary-results-of-wwi-seminal-catastrophe.html#Results of World War I\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">World War I did not resolve any of the problems or international tensions that had started it</a>. Instead, it made them worse because it proved how powerful and devastating modern weapons were, and it also demonstrated that no single power was likely to be able to assert its dominance.

Thus, many Germans felt they had been wronged twice: they had not “really” lost the war, yet they were forced to pay outrageous indemnities to the “victors.”It was in this context of anger and disappointment that fascism and its racially-obsessed offshoot Nazism arose. World War I provided the trauma, the bloodshed, and the skepticism toward liberalism and socialism that underwrote the rise of fascism. Fascism was a modern conservatism, a conservatism that clung to its mania for order and hierarchy, but which did not seek a return to the days of feudalism and monarchy. It was a populist movement, a movement of the people by the people, but instead of petty democratic bickering, it glorified the (imagined) nation, a nation united by a movement and an ethos.<br>→ <a data-href=\"402-II - The Rise of Fascism\" href=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">402-II - The Rise of Fascism</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Rise of Authoritarian and Totalitarian States","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_Authoritarian_and_Totalitarian_States_0"},{"heading":"Context of Fascism","level":2,"id":"Context_of_Fascism_0"}],"links":["400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-viii-summary-results-of-wwi-seminal-catastrophe.html#Results of World War I","400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-ii-the-peace-treaties.html#Dolchstosslegende / Stab in the Back myth","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756282027939,"modifiedTime":1757060498092,"sourceSize":4899,"sourcePath":"400 Year4/402 Totalitarianism/402-I - Failing of Democracy.md","exportPath":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":106,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html":{"title":"402-II - The Rise of Fascism","icon":"","description":"Comprehension and beyond (keep in mind while reading, answer after) Name and define the elements of fascism\nIn what way do these elements oppose liberalism, parliamentarianism, and democracy?\nWhat do you think it takes for single-party systems to be established in a state?\nWhere do you see dangers of something like this happening in today’s democracies?\n→ Formulate clear, written answers of 2-3 sentences per question Roman Fasces\n<img alt=\"Fasces.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/fasces.jpg\" target=\"_self\">\nRoman fasces, (lat.: “bundle”). symbol of power, unity, and jurisdiction (especially High Justice: having the right to condemn to death) Fascism centered on the glorification of the state, the rejection of liberal individualism, and an incredible emphasis on hierarchy and authority. Fascist movements sprung up right as the war ended. The term fascism was invented by the Italian Fascist Party itself, based on the term fasces: a bundle of sticks with an axe embedded in the middle. Symbolically, the sticks are weak individually but strong as a group, and the axe represented the power over life and death. In ancient Rome, the bodyguards of the Roman consuls carried the fasces as a badge of authority over war, peace, law, and death, and that symbolism appealed to the Italian Fascists.<br>By the early 1920s, there were fascist movements in many European countries, all of them agitating for some kind of right-wing revolution against democracy and socialism. One place of particular note in the early history of fascism was France. There, a right-wing monarchist group called Actione Française had existed since the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Dreyfus-affair\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Dreyfus-affair\" target=\"_self\">Dreyfus Affair</a>, but it transformed itself into a French fascist group despite still clinging to monarchist and traditional Catholic ideologies. When Germany defeated France in World War I, the Nazis found a large contingent of right-wing Frenchmen who were all too happy to create a home-grown French fascist state (a fact that many in France tried their best to forget after the war). Likewise, when the Nazis seized power in various places in Eastern Europe, they often found it expedient to simply work with or appoint the already-existing local fascist groups to power.Fascism was a twentieth-century phenomenon, but its ideological roots were firmly planted in the nineteenth century. Mostly obviously, fascism was an extreme form of nationalism. The nation was not just the home of a “people” in fascism, it was everything. The nation became a mythic entity that had existed since the ancient past, and fascists claimed that the cultural traits and patterns of the nation defined who a person was and how they regarded the world.☝︎ Discuss the last sentence with a partner and write a paragraph (at least)The confusing jumble of what defined a nation in the first place often took on explicitly racial, and racist, terms among fascist groups. Now, Germans were not just people who spoke German in Central Europe; they were the German (or “Aryan,” the term itself nothing more than a pseudo-scholarly jumble of linguistic history and racist nonsense) “race.” French fascists talked about the bloodlines of the ancient Gauls that supposedly survived despite the “pollution” of the Roman invasions in the ancient past. Likewise, Mussolini and the Italian Fascists claimed that “the Italians” were the direct descendants of the most glorious tradition of the ancient Roman Empire and were destined to create a new, even greater empire. The pseudo-sciences of race had arisen in the late nineteenth century as perverse offshoots of genuine advances in biology and the natural sciences. Fascism was, among other things, a cultural movement that found in “scientific” racism a profoundly compatible doctrine: the “scientific” proof in the rightness of the racial nation’s rise to power.At first sight, one surprising aspect of fascism was that many fascists were former communists – Benito Mussolini, the leader of the Italian Fascist Party, had been a prominent member of the Italian Communist Party before World War I. What fascism and communism had in common was a rejection of bourgeois parliamentary democracy. They both sought transcendent political and social orders that went beyond “mere” parliamentary compromise. The major difference between them was that fascists discovered in World War I that most people were not willing to die for their social class, but they were willing to die for their nation. Fascism was, in part, a kind of collective movement that substituted nationalism for the class war. All classes would be united in the nation, fascists believed, for the greater glory of the race and movement.Reflect …\n… on the similarities of fascism and socialism\nAs noted above, the very term “fascist” is a product of the first fascist group to seize control of a powerful country: the Italian Fascist Party. Italian Fascism was an invention of Italian army veterans. Most important among them was Benito Mussolini, a combat veteran who had welcomed the war as a cleansing, invigorating opportunity for Italy to grow into a more powerful nation. He was deeply disappointed by its lackluster aftermath. Italy, having joined with England and France against Germany and Austria in hopes of seizing territory from the Austrians, was given very little land after the war. Thus, to Mussolini and many other Italians, the war had been especially pointless.The Fascists, who started out with a mere 100 members in the northern Italian city of Milan, grew rapidly because of the incredible social turmoil in Italy in 1919 and 1920. Italy had a powerful communist movement, one that was inspired by and linked to the Soviet Union’s recent birth and the success of the communist revolution in Russia. After the war, a huge strike wave struck Italy and many poor Italians in the countryside seized land from the semi-feudal landlords who still dominated rural society. There was genuine concern among traditional conservatives, the church, business leaders, and the middle classes that Italy would undergo a communist revolution just as had occurred in Russia – at the time Russia was still in the midst of its civil war between the Red Bolsheviks and the anti-communist coalition known as the Whites. By 1920 the Reds were clearly winning.<br>Blackshirts\n<img alt=\"800px-march_on_rome.1020x680.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/800px-march_on_rome.1020x680.jpg\" target=\"_self\"> Mussolini with Camicie nere\nThe Fascists organized themselves into paramilitary units of thugs known as the Blackshirts (for their party-issued uniforms) and engaged in open street fighting against communists, breaking up strikes, attacking communist leaders, destroying communist newspaper offices, and intimidating voters from communist-leaning neighborhoods and communities. They were often tacitly aided by the police, who rounded up communists but ignored Fascist lawbreaking as long as it was directed against the communists. Likewise, business leaders started funding the Fascists as a kind of guarantee against further gains by communists. Fascist politicians ran for office in the Italian parliament while their gangs of thugs terrorized the opposition.In 1922, the weak-willed King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele III, appointed Mussolini Prime Minister, seeing in Mussolini a bulwark against the threat of communism (and caving in to the growing strength of the Fascist Party). Fascists from all over Italy converged in a famous “March on Rome,” a highly staged piece of political theater meant to demonstrate Fascist unity and strength. Mussolini then set out to destroy Italian democracy from within. From 1922 to 1926 Mussolini and the Fascists manipulated the Italian parliament, intimidated political opponents or actually had them murdered, and succeeded finally in eliminating party politics and a free press. The Fascist party became the only legal party in Italy and the police apparatus expanded dramatically. Mussolini’s official title was Il Duce: The Leader, and his authority over every political decision was absolute. The Fascist motto was “believe, obey, fight,” a distant parody of the French liberal motto (from the French Revolution) “liberty, equality, fraternity.”Reflect\nWhat role did authority, the rule of law, and democratic structures play in the rise of fascism?\n<br>Mass spectacle <img alt=\"960px-Naples_Fascist_rally_on_24_October_1922_(2).jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/960px-naples_fascist_rally_on_24_october_1922_(2).jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br>\nDuring the March on Rome, 1922 <img alt=\"Parata_Camice_Nere_in_Corso_Libertà_a_Bolzano.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/parata_camice_nere_in_corso_libertà_a_bolzano.jpg\" target=\"_self\">\nParade in 1930\nMussolini immediately understood the importance of appearances. The 1920s was the early age of mass media, especially radio, and an intrinsic part of fascism was public spectacle. Mussolini staged enormous public exhibitions and rallies and he carefully controlled how he was portrayed in the media – the press was forbidden to mention his age or his birthday, to give the illusion that he never aged. He was always on the move, usually in a race car, and usually accompanied by models, actresses, and socialites years his junior. He spoke about his own animal magnetism and often walked around without a shirt on as a kind of (would be) herculean archetype.\nOfficially, Italian Fascism promised to end the class conflict that lay at the heart of socialist ideology by favoring what it called “corporatism” over mere capitalism. Corporatism was supposed to be a unified decision-making system in which workers and business owners would serve on joint committees to control work. In fact, the owners derived all of the benefits; trade unions were banned and the plight of workers degenerated without representation.What Italian Fascism did do for the Italian people was essentially ideological and, in a sense, emotional: it directed youth movements and recreational clubs and sought the involvement of all Italians. It glorified the idea of the Italian people and in turn many actual Italians did come to feel great national pride, even if they were working in difficult conditions in a stagnant economy. In turn, Fascist propaganda tried to inculcate Italian pride and Fascist identity among Italian citizens, while Fascist-led police forces targeted would-be dissidents, sentencing thousands to prison terms or internal exile in closed prison villages (not unlike some of the Russian gulags that would exemplify a different but related totalitarian system to the east).While Mussolini was often praised in the foreign press, including in American newspapers and magazines, for accomplishments like making (a few) Italian trains run on time, in the long term the Fascist government proved to be inefficient and often outright ineffectual. Mussolini himself, convinced of his own genius, made arbitrary and often foolish decisions, especially when it came to building up and training the Italian military. The circle of Fascist leaders around him were largely corrupt sycophants who lied to Mussolini about Italy’s strength and prosperity to keep him happy. When World War II began in 1939, the Italian forces were revealed to be poorly trained, equipped, and led.<br><img alt=\"402-II-rise of fascism.svg\" src=\"resources/402-ii-rise-of-fascism.svg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Fascism in general","level":2,"id":"Fascism_in_general_0"},{"heading":"Fascism in Italy","level":2,"id":"Fascism_in_Italy_0"},{"heading":"Rise of Fascism","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_Fascism_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/fasces.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/800px-march_on_rome.1020x680.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/960px-naples_fascist_rally_on_24_october_1922_(2).html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/parata_camice_nere_in_corso_libertà_a_bolzano.html","resources/402-ii-rise-of-fascism.html"],"createdTime":1756218421240,"modifiedTime":1761211241099,"sourceSize":11805,"sourcePath":"400 Year4/402 Totalitarianism/402-II - The Rise of Fascism.md","exportPath":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":107,"backlinks":["400-year4/401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-iv-totalitarianism.html"],"type":"markdown"},"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-iii-from-the-world-of-symbols.html":{"title":"402-III - From the World of Symbols","icon":"","description":"Discuss Collect symbols from your real life.

By 1939, only two major states (Great Britain and France) and several minor ones (the Low Countries, the Scandinavian states, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia) remained democratic. What had happened to Woodrow Wilson's claim that World War I had been fought to make the world safe for democracy? Actually, World War I turned out to have had the opposite effect.The postwar expansion of the electorate made mass politics a reality and seemed to enhance the spread of democracy in Europe. But the war itself had created conditions that led the new mass electorate to distrust democracy and move toward a more radicalized politics.Many postwar societies were badly divided, especially along class lines. During the war, to maintain war production, governments had been forced to make concessions to trade unions and socialist parties, which strengthened the working class after the war. At the same time, the position of many middle-class people had declined as consumer industries had been curtailed during the war and war bonds, which had been purchased by the middle classes as their patriotic contribution to the war effort, sank in value and even became worthless in some countries.Gender divisions also weakened social cohesion. After the war, as soldiers returned home, women were forced out of jobs they had taken during the war, jobs that many newly independent women wanted to retain. The loss of so many men during the war had also left many younger women with no marital prospects and widows with no choice but to find jobs in the labor force. At the same time, fears about a declining population because of the war led many male political leaders to encourage women to return to their traditional roles as wives and mothers. Many European countries outlawed abortions and curtailed the sale of birth control devices while providing increased welfare benefits to entice women to remain at home and bear children.The Great Depression served to deepen social conflict. Larger and larger numbers of people felt victimized, first by the war and now by socioeconomic conditions that seemed beyond their control. Postwar politics became more and more polarized as people reverted to the wartime practice of dividing into friends and enemies, downplaying compromise and emphasizing conflict. Moderate centrist parties that supported democracy soon found themselves with fewer and fewer allies as people became increasingly radicalized politically, supporting the extremes of left-wing communism or right-wing fascism. In the 1920s, Italy had become the first fascist state, while the newborn Soviet Union moved toward a repressive communist state. In the 1930s, a host of other European nations adopted authoritarian structures of various kinds. Is it justified to call any of them totalitarian states?<br>The word totalitarian was first used by Benito Mussolini in Italy to describe his new Fascist state: \"Fascism is totalitarian,\" he declared. A number of historians eventually applied the term to both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"402-II - The Rise of Fascism\" data-href=\"402-II - The Rise of Fascism\" href=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">→ Fascist Italy</a>). Especially during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union that followed World War II in the 1950s and 1960s, Western leaders were inclined to apply the term totalitarian to both the Soviet Union and the eastern European states that had been brought under Soviet control.What did the historians who used the term think were the characteristics of a totalitarian state? Totalitarian regimes, it was argued, extended the functions and power of the central state far beyond what they had in the past. The totalitarian state expected the active loyalty and commitment of its citizens to the regime's goals and used modern mass propaganda techniques and high-speed modern communications to conquer the minds and hearts of its subjects. The total state aimed to control not only the economic, political, and social aspects of life but the intellectual and cultural aspects as well. The purpose of that control was the active involvement of the masses in the achievement of the regime's goal, whether it be war, a socialist state, or a thousand-year Reich.Moreover, the so-called totalitarian state was to be led by a single leader and a single party and would ruthlessly reject the liberal ideal of limited government power and constitutional guarantees of individual freedoms. Indeed, individual freedom was to be subordinated to the collective will of the masses, organized and determined for them by a leader. It was also believed that modern technology gave these states unprecedented ability to use police controls to enforce their wishes on their subjects.By the 1970s and 1980s, however, revisionist historians were questioning the usefulness of the term totalitarian and regarded it as crude and imprecise. Certainly, some regimes, such as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union, sought total control, but these states exhibited significant differences, and none of them was successful in establishing total control of its society.\n[text: Jackson J.

Despite the failure, this brought Hitler and the Nazis national attention, leading to their complete assumption of power within a decade.Following Germany's WWI defeat, the democratic Weimar Republic was established by a coalition of Social Democrats, the Catholic Center Party, and German Democrats. This fragmented republic lacked strong leadership and remained unstable. In 1925, WWI military hero Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934) became president — a traditionalist monarchist fundamentally opposed to republican government. The republic faced constant political threats from both leftist and rightist uprisings.\nEconomic crises compounded political instability. Runaway inflation in 1922-1923 destroyed middle-class savings and fixed incomes, driving these groups toward anti-republican rightist parties. After brief recovery (1924-1929), the Great Depression struck, pushing unemployment to 4.4 million by December 1930. These combined political, economic, and social crises created conditions enabling Hitler and the Nazis to seize power.Born in 1889, Adolf Hitler was the son of an Austrian customs official. He was a total failure in secondary school and eventually made his way to Vienna to become an artist. In Vienna, Hitler established the basic ideas of an ideology from which he never deviated for the rest of his life. At the core of Hitler's ideas was racism, especially anti-Semitism. Hitler had also become an extreme German nationalist who had learned from the mass politics of Vienna how political parties could effectively use propaganda and terror.

He joined the obscure German Workers' Party, one of a number of right-wing extreme nationalist parties in Munich. By the summer of 1921, Hitler had assumed control of the party, which he renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or Nazi Party for short. His idea was that the party's name would distinguish the Nazis from the socialist parties while gaining support from both working-class and nationalist circles. Hitler worked assiduously to develop the party into a mass political movement with flags, badges, uniforms, its own newspaper, and its own police force or party militia known as the SA, the Sturmabteilung, or Storm Troops. The SA was used to defend the party in meeting halls and to break up the meetings of other parties. Hitler's own oratorical skills were largely responsible for attracting an increasing number of followers . By 1923, the party's membership had grown from its early hundreds to 55,000, with 15,000 in the SA.Overconfident, Hitler staged an armed uprising against the government in Munich in November 1923. The so-called Beer Hall Putsch was quickly crushed, and Hitler was sentenced to prison. During his brief stay in jail, Hitler wrote ”Mein Kampf” (My Struggle), an autobiographical account of his movement and its underlying ideology. Extreme German nationalism, virulent anti-Semitism, and vicious anti-communism are linked by a Social Darwinian theory of struggle that stresses the right of superior nations to Lebensraum (living space) through expansion and the right of “superior” individuals to secure authoritarian leadership over the masses.

During his imprisonment, Hitler also came to the realization that the Nazis would have to acquire power by constitutional means, not by overthrowing the Weimar Republic. This implied the formation of a mass political party that would actively compete for votes with the other political parties. After his release from prison, Hitler reorganized the Nazi Party on a regional basis and expanded it to all parts of Germany. By 1929, the Nazis had a national party organization whose membership had grown from 27,000 in 1925 to 178,000 by the end of 1929. Especially noticeable was the youthfulness of the regional, district, and branch leaders of the Nazi orga- nization. Many were under thirty and were fiercely committed to Hitler because he gave them the kind of active politics they sought. Rather than democratic debate, they wanted brawls in beer halls, enthusiastic speeches, and comradeship in the building of a new Germany. One new, young Nazi member expressed his excitement about the party:A new, young Nazi member:\n“For me this was the start of a completely new life. There was only one thing in the world for me and that was service in the movement. All my thoughts were centered on the movement. I could talk only politics. I was no longer aware of anything else. At the time I was a promising athlete; I was very keen on sport, and it was going to be my career. But I had to give this up too. My only interest was agitation and propaganda.”1\nSuch youthful enthusiasm gave the Nazi movement an aura of a \"young man's movement\" and a sense of dyna- mism that the other parties could not match.By 1932, the Nazi Party had 800,000 members and had become the largest party in the Reichstag. No doubt Germany's economic difficulties were a crucial factor in the Nazi rise to power. Unemployment increased dramatically, from 4.4 million at the start of 1931 to 6 million by the winter of 1932. The economic and psychological impact of the Great Depression made extremist parties more attractive. The Nazis were especially effective in developing modern electioneering techniques. In their campaigns, party members pitched their themes to the needs and fears of different social groups. But even as they were making blatant appeals to class interests, the Nazis were denouncing conflicts of interest and maintaining that they stood above classes and parties. Hitler, in particular, claimed to transcend all differences and promised to create a new Germany free of class differences and party infighting. His appeal to national pride, national honor, and traditional militarism struck chords of emotion in his listeners.Increasingly, the right-wing elites of Germany – the industrial magnates, landed aristocrats, military establishment, and higher bureaucrats – began to see Hitler as the man who had the mass support to establish an authoritarian regime that would save Germany and their privileged positions from a communist takeover. Under pressure, President Hindenburg agreed to allow Hitler to become chancellor (on January 30, 1933) and form a new government.Question Explain the influence of the Great Depression on the rise of the Nazi party.\nThe Conservatives wanted to weaken Hitler by binding him to political responsibility. Why do you think this didn't work? Within two months, Hitler had laid the foundations for the Nazis' complete control of Germany. The day after a fire broke out in the Reichstag building (February 27), supposedly set by the Communists, Hitler convinced President Hindenburg to issue a decree that gave the government emergency powers. It suspended all basic rights of citizens for the duration of the emergency, thus enabling the Nazis to arrest and imprison anyone without redress. The final step in Hitler's \"legal seizure\" (\"Machtergreifung\") of power came on March 23 when a two-thirds majority of the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act (Ermächtigungsgesetz), which empowered the government to dispense with constitutional forms for four years while it issued laws that would deal with the country's problems. In effect, Hitler became a dictator appointed by parliament.With their new source of power, the Nazis acted quickly to enforce Gleichschaltung the coordination of all institutions under Nazi control. The civil service was purged of Jews and democratic elements, concentration camps were established for opponents of the new regime, the autonomy of the federal states was eliminated, trade unions were dissolved, and all political parties except the Nazis were abolished. By the end of the summer of 1933, within seven months of being appointed chancellor, Hitler and the Nazis had established the foundations for a totalitarian state. When Hindenburg died on August 2, 1934, the office of president was abolished, and Hitler became the sole ruler of Germany. Public officials and soldiers were all required to take a personal oath of loyalty to Hitler as the \"Führer (leader) of the German Reich and people.\" Text sourcePolitics of the Nazis\nCampaigns by Hitler/Nazis were not very effective (study from 2018)\nmuch more important: economical situation weakness of institutions countless moments when Hitler should have failed, but there was “a system that let it happen” (Peter Ross Range, 2020)\nPoster for the Reichstags elections on 31 July 1932\n→ analyse, interpret<br>\n<img alt=\"Artikel_44553_bilder_value_8_nsdap11.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/artikel_44553_bilder_value_8_nsdap11.jpg\" target=\"_self\">\nIn your own words\nExplain what factors led to the rise of the Nazis, what role other politicians played, and how the economy contributed to the rise.\n<br><img alt=\"402-V-rise of hitler and nazis 1919-39.svg\" src=\"resources/402-v-rise-of-hitler-and-nazis-1919-39.svg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Context: The Weimar Republic","level":2,"id":"Context_The_Weimar_Republic_0"},{"heading":"Rise of the Nazis","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_the_Nazis_0"},{"heading":"The Nazi Seizure of Power","level":2,"id":"The_Nazi_Seizure_of_Power_0"},{"heading":"Rise of Hitler and the Nazis (1919-1939)","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_Hitler_and_the_Nazis_(1919-1939)_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"resources/402-volkish-movement.png","fullURL":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-v-hitler-and-the-nazis.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["resources/402-volkish-movement.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/die_zeitschrift_der_völkischen_bewegung,_1919.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/plakat_voelkischer_block.html","400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/artikel_44553_bilder_value_8_nsdap11.html","resources/402-v-rise-of-hitler-and-nazis-1919-39.html"],"createdTime":1757335562022,"modifiedTime":1761212090919,"sourceSize":11260,"sourcePath":"400 Year4/402 Totalitarianism/402-V - Hitler and the Nazis.md","exportPath":"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-v-hitler-and-the-nazis.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":110,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/402-vi-the-nazi-state.html":{"title":"402-VI - The Nazi State","icon":"","description":"The Nazi government that followed was a mess of overlapping bureaucracies with no clear areas of control, just influence. The Weimar constitution was never officially repudiated, but the letter of laws became far less important than their interpretation according to the “spirit” of Nazism. In lieu of a rational political order, there was a kind of governing principle that one Nazi party member described as “working towards the Führer”: trying to determine the “spirit” of Nazism and abiding by it rather than following specific rules or laws. The only unshakable core principle was the personal supremacy of the “Führer”, who was supposed to embody Nazism itself.Nazism was not just a governing philosophy, however. Hitler was obsessed with winning over “ordinary Germans” to the party’s outlook, and to that end the state both bombarded the population with propaganda and sought to alleviate the dismal economic situation of the early 1930s. The Nazi state poured money into a debt-based recovery from the Depression (the economics of the recovery were totally unsustainable, but the Nazi leadership gambled that war would come before the inevitable economic collapse). Employment recovered somewhat as the state funded huge public works and, after he publicly broke with the terms of the Versailles Treaty in 1935, rearmament. Even though there were still food and consumable shortages, many Germans felt that things were better than they had been. The Nazis refused to continue war reparations and soon the rapidly-rebuilding military was staging enormous public rallies.Ultimately, the Nazi party controlled Germany from 1933 until Germany surrendered to the Allies in World War II in 1945 - that period is remembered as that of the Third Reich, the Nazis’ own term for what Hitler promised would be a “1,000 years” of German dominance. During that time, the Nazis sponsored a full-scale attempt to recreate German culture and society to correspond with their vision of a racialized, warlike, and “purified” German nation. They claimed to have launched a “national revolution” in the name of unifying all Germans in one Volksgemeinschaft: people’s community.The Nazis targeted almost every conceivable social group with a specific propaganda campaign and encouraged (or required) German citizens to join a specific Nazi league: workers were encouraged to work hard for the good of the state, women were encouraged to produce as many healthy children as possible (and to stay out of the workplace), boys were enrolled in a paramilitary scouting organization, the Hitler Youth, and girls in the League of German Girls, trained as future mothers and domestics. All vocations and genders were united in the glorification of the military and, of course, of the Führer himself (“Heil Hitler” was the official greeting used by millions of German citizens, whether or not they ever joined the Nazi party itself). The purpose of the campaigns was to win the loyalty of the population to the regime and to Hitler personally, and nearly the entire population at least paid lip service to the new norms.Hitler:\nWe must develop organizations in which an individual's entire life can take place. Then every activity and every need of every individual will be regulated by the collectivity represented by the party. There is no longer any arbitrary will, there are no longer any free realms in which the individual belongs to himself .. .. The time of personal happiness is over.\nMulti column\nBDM\n<img alt=\"pli03468.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/pli03468.jpg\" target=\"_self\"> HJ\n<img alt=\"628_1.jpg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/628_1.jpg\" target=\"_self\"> The dark side of both the propaganda and the legal framework of the Third Reich was the suspension of civil rights and the concomitant campaigns against the so-called “enemies” of the German people. The Nazis vilified Jews, as well as other groups like people with disabilities and the Romani (better known as “Gypsies,” although the term itself is something of an ethnic slur). Starting in 1933, the state began a campaign of involuntary sterilizations of disabled and mixed-race peoples. Jewish businesses were targeted for vandalism and Jewish people were attacked. In 1935 the Nazis passed the so-called “Nuremberg Laws”☟ which outlawed Jews from working in various professions, stripped Jews of citizenship, and made sex between Jews and non-Jews a serious crime.Even as Germans were encouraged to identify with the Nazi state, and joining the Nazi Party itself soon became an excellent way to advance one’s career, the Nazis also held out the threat of imprisonment or death for those who dared defy them. The first concentration camp was opened within weeks of Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in 1933, and a vast web of police forces soon monitored the German population. The most important organization in Nazi Germany was the SS (Schutzstaffel, meaning “protection squadron”), an enormous force of dedicated Nazis with almost unlimited police powers. The SS had the right to hold anyone indefinitely, without trial, in ”protective custody” in a concentration camp, and the Nazi secret police, the Gestapo, were merely one part of the SS. This combination of incentives (e.g. propaganda, programs, incentives) and threats (e.g. the SS, concentration camps) helps explain why there was no significant resistance to the Nazi regime from within Germany.[text: Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 3]Women held essential positions in the Aryan racial state as bearers of children who would ensure Aryan race triumph. Nazis viewed gender differences as natural: men served as warriors and political leaders while women were destined as wives and mothers. Motherhood received exaltation through annual August 12 ceremonies on Hitler's mother's birthday, when Hitler presented the German Mother's Cross to selected German mothers. Recipients with four children received bronze crosses, six children earned silver crosses, and eight or more children merited a gold cross.Nazi ideology shaped women's employment opportunities. The regime sought to remove women from heavy industry and jobs potentially hindering healthy childbearing, plus certain professions including university teaching, law, and medicine, deemed inappropriate for women, particularly married women. Nazis encouraged women toward professional occupations with direct practical application, such as social work and nursing. Beyond restrictive legislation against females, the Nazi regime promoted its anti-working women campaign through poster slogans like \"Get hold of pots and pans and broom and sooner you will find a groom!\" <br>9 Commandments for the Workers’ Struggle\n<img alt=\"701731.jpeg\" src=\"400-year4/402-totalitarianism/attachments/701731.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nPublished in 1934 in the Berliner Morgenpost and on Posters, under the lead of Herrmann Göring.\nOn the position of women regarding work (Göring)\nPosition 3:\n“Dem deutschen Mädel:\nPack Kochtopf, Schaufel und Besen an,\nDu bekommst viel eher einen Mann.\nErkenne deinen natürlichen Beruf und – handle danach.

After gaining power, the Nazis implemented these concepts through anti-Semitic policies. In September 1935, the Nazis announced new racial laws at the annual Nuremberg party rally. These \"Nuremberg laws\" stripped German Jews of German citizenship, prohibited marriages and extramarital relations between Jews and German citizens, and fundamentally separated Jews from Germans politically, socially, and legally.

A Polish Jew's assassination of a low-ranking German embassy secretary in Paris provided the pretext for Nazi-led destructive rampage against German Jews. Synagogues were burned, seven thousand Jewish businesses destroyed, and at least one hundred Jews killed. Additionally, thirty thousand Jewish males were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Further drastic measures followed: Jews were banned from all public buildings and prohibited from owning, managing, or working in retail stores. Finally, under SS direction, Jews were \"encouraged\" to emigrate from Germany. Following World War II's outbreak, emigration policy was replaced by a more gruesome alternative.Discuss the questions, write answers: ‘The time of personal happiness is over.’ → put this quote into a wider historical context, comment on it and discuss it.\nThe Nazis used the economy for their ends.
