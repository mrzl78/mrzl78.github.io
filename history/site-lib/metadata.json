Humans did not, therefore, consciously take up crop growing and animal raising because they thought they would have a more secure and satisfying life. In other words, humans seem to have been “pushed” into agriculture rather than “pulled” into it.<br>The coming of agrarian societies was almost certainly connected to the waning<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-12c64ff2f44a92cc\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> of the Pleistocene, or Ice Age, that is, the period, beginning about 15 000 years ago, when glaciers shrank and both sea levels and global temperatures rose. In several parts of the Northern Hemisphere rainfall increased significantly. Rising seas drowned low-lying coastal shelves as well as land bridges that had previously connected regions separated by water today. Land bridges now under water included spans between Siberia and Alaska, Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Britain and continental Europe.<br>\nOne consequence of the great thaw was that across much of the Northern Hemisphere warmer, rainier, ice-free conditions permitted forests, meadowlands<a data-footref=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2-12c64ff2f44a92cc\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and small animal populations to flourish. The natural bounty was so great in some localities that human bands began to settle in one place all or part of the year to forage and hunt. That is, they became sedentary, settled in hamlets or villages rather than moving from camp to camp. For example, in the relatively well-watered part of the Middle East we call the Fertile Crescent, groups began sometime between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago to found tiny settlements in order to collect plentiful stands of wild grain and other edible plants and animals.<br>The Fertile Crescent\n<img alt=\"Fertile Crescent\" src=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/50/64950-050-7FF76F71/cities-records-rivers-mouths-Euphrates-Tigris-countries.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\n<br>In time, these groups learned how to control and manipulate the reproduction of plants that were bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and easier to grow, harvest, store, and cook than were wild food plants. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies > Animal Domestication and its Effects\" data-href=\"I - Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies#Animal Domestication and its Effects\" href=\"102-neolithicization/i-farming-and-the-emergence-of-complex-societies.html#Animal Domestication and its Effects\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Systematic domestication</a> was under way!\nIn the Fertile Crescent key domesticates included the ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, and several other edible plants. Selecting and breeding particular animal species – sheep, goats, cattle, pigs – that were good to eat and easy to manage occurred in a similar way. In effect, humans started grooming the natural environment to reduce the organisms they did not want (weeds, predatory wolves) and to increase the number of organisms they did want (grains, legumes, wool-bearing sheep, hunting dogs).<br>The intensification in population densities and economic productivity that farming permitted also led humans to intervene in the natural and physical environment as never before. As farmers cleared more land, planted more crops, and pastured more animals, they enhanced their species’ biological success.

More details on Freud and his influence there.\nSigmund Freud (1856 - 1939) had a great influence on how humans were seen. Freud was one of the founders of the medical and scientific discipline of psychology. He was the forefather of the concept of modern therapy itself and his theories, while now largely rejected by psychologists in terms of their empirical accuracy, nevertheless continue to exert tremendous influence. In historical hindsight, Freud’s importance derives from his work as a philosopher of the mind more so than as a “scientist” per se, although it was precisely his drive for his work to be respected as a true science that inspired his research and writing. One major theme present in Freud’s theories had to do with sexuality, which he believed to be of central importance to psychology. His theories largely revolved around sexual instincts and their repression, and he invented various specific concepts like the “Oedipus complex,” the idea that young boys sexually desire their mothers and fear the authority of their fathers, and “penis envy,” the claim that girls are psychologically wounded by not having male genitalia, that he claimed were fundamental to the human psyche. For all his insight, and all his clinical work with women patients, however, Freud remained convinced that women were in a sense less “evolved” than men and were biologically destined for a secondary role. He also admitted that he could not really figure out women’s motivations; he famously asserted that the question that psychology could not answer was “what does a woman want?” In the end, the irony of Freud’s take on gender and sexuality is that it simply reproduced age-old sexual stereotypes and double standards, however important his other theories were in exploring the unconscious. Despite the genuine changes occurring to gender in the society around him, Freud remained embedded in the assumption that a male and female physiology dictated separate and unequal destinies for men and women. Those destinies, however, were slowly changing. Gender roles had been transformed both economically and culturally during (and because of) the war. Some of those changes were durable. The range of jobs available to women was certainly larger than it had been before the war. Women continued to wear more comfortable and practical clothing after the war than before it, the restrictive ankle-length dress replaced by the looser, calf-length dress or skirt. Some women continued to cut their hair short, and of course women’s suffrage was finally realized (albeit with various restrictions) in most European countries and the United States over the course of the 1920s.<br>\nNo sooner had the war ended, however, that men generally did everything in their power to reverse many of the changes to gender roles it had caused. Through a combination of legal restrictions and quasi-legal practices, women were forced from traditional male jobs, prevented from enrolling in universities and medical schools, and paid significantly less than men for the same work. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"402-II The Rise of Fascism\" data-href=\"402-II The Rise of Fascism\" href=\"402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fascist parties</a> were explicitly devoted to enforcing traditional gender roles, and when some countries were overtaken by fascist rule women were often forced out of the workplace. Everywhere, most men (and many women) continued to insist that women were inherently biologically inferior to men and that it was the “natural” role of men to serve as head of the household and head of the nation-state in equal measure. <br>Flappers\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg/500px-Alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nThe American actor Alice Joyce in 1926 in an extravagant “flapper” dress. Film stars of the day were the most visible examples of the “New Woman” most people encountered outside of advertising.\nThe exemplar of both the greater freedom enjoyed by women and male resentment of that freedom was the “New Woman.” A stock figure in the media of the time, the New Woman was independent, working at her own job full time and living by herself, and able to enjoy a social life that included drinking, dancing, and even the possibility of casual sex. The famous “flappers” of the 1920s, young women in the latest fashion who danced to cutting-edge American jazz and wore scandalously short, knee-length dresses, were the ultimate expression of the New Woman. While the image of the New Woman was greatly exaggerated, both in advertising and by male misogynists, there was at least a kernel of truth to the archetype. Far more women were independent by the 1920s than in the past, fashions really had changed, and thanks to halting advances in contraception, casual sexual relationships were easier to have without fear of pregnancy. It would take at least another half-century, however, for laws against sexual discrimination to come into being in most countries, and of course the struggle for cultural equality remains unfulfilled to this day. | ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalysis","level":2,"id":"Sigmund_Freud_and_Psychoanalysis_0"},{"heading":"Gender Roles","level":2,"id":"Gender_Roles_0"}],"links":["402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg/500px-Alicejoyce1926full_crop.jpg","fullURL":"401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756283193054,"modifiedTime":1756717245531,"sourceSize":5481,"sourcePath":"401 Interwar Period and Totalitarianism/401-VI - Interwar Society.md","exportPath":"401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":26,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vii-democratic-states.html":{"title":"401-VII - Democratic States","icon":"","description":"Combine, deduct, speculate\nWhat might be reasons why Britain, France, and the USA did not turn away from democracy? Consider the texts below, as well as the other parts of the chapter and of their history. Feel free to do research online.\nAfter World War I, Great Britain went through a period of serious economic difficulties. During the war, Britain had lost many of the markets for its industrial products, especially to the United States and Japan. The post- war decline of such staple industries as coal, steel, and textiles led to a rise in unemployment, which reached the 2 million mark in 1921. Britain soon rebounded, however, and from 1925 to 1929 experienced renewed prosperity.\nBut Britain was not immune to the effects of the Great Depression. The Labour Party, now the largest party in Britain, failed to solve the nation's economic problems and fell from power in 1931. A National Government (a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives) claimed credit for bringing Britain out of the worst stages of the depression, primarily by using the traditional policies of balanced budgets and protective tariffs. British politicians largely ignored the new ideas of a Cambridge economist, John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), who published A General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. He condemned the traditional view that in a free economy, depressions should be left to work themselves out. Instead, Keynes argued that unemployment stemmed not from overproduction but from a decline in demand and that demand could be increased by public works, financed, if necessary, through deficit spending to stimulate production. (see below, USA)After the defeat of Germany, France had become the strongest power on the European continent. Its greatest need was to rebuild the devastated areas of northern and eastern France. But no French government seemed capable of solving France's financial problems between 1921 and 1926. Like other European countries, though, France did experience a period of relative prosperity between 1926 and 1929. By 1932, France began to feel the full effects of the Great Depression, and economic instability soon had political repercussions. During a nineteen-month period in 1932 and 1933, six different cabinets were formed as France faced political chaos. Finally, in 1936, fearful that rightists intended to seize power, a coalition of leftist parties-Socialists and Radicals-formed a Popular Front government.\nAlthough the Popular Front succeeded in initiating a program for workers that established the right of collective bargaining, a forty-hour workweek, two-week paid vacations, and minimum wages, its policies failed to solve the problems of the depression. By 1938, the French were experiencing a serious decline of confidence in their political system that left them unprepared to deal with their aggressive Nazi enemy to the east. After Germany, no Western nation was more affected by the Great Depression than the United States. By the end of 1932, industrial production had fallen to 50 percent of its 1929 level. Soon there were 15 million unemployed. Under these circumstances, the Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) won the 1932 presidential election by a landslide. He and his advisers pursued a policy of active government intervention in the economy that came to be known as the New Deal. To support the nation's banks, they established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured the safety of bank deposits up to $5,000. A key feature of the New Deal was a stepped-up program of public works undertaken by new government agencies such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA), established in 1935; this agency put between 2 and 3 million people to work building bridges, roads, post offices, and airports. The Roosevelt administration was also responsible for social legislation that launched the American welfare state. In 1935, the Social Security Act created a system of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.\nThe New Deal provided some social reform measures that perhaps averted the possibility of social revolution in the United States. It did not, however, solve the unemployment problems of the Great Depression. In May 1937, during what was considered a period of full recovery, American unemployment still stood at 7 million; by the following year, it had increased to 11 million. Only World War II and the subsequent growth of armament-related industries brought American workers back to full employment.

It undermined the faith in progress that had grown, despite all of its setbacks, throughout the nineteenth century among many, perhaps most, Europeans. The major political movements of the nineteenth century, namely nationalism, liberalism, and socialism seemed to have succeeded: everywhere in Europe nations replaced empires, and Europe controlled more of the world in 1920 than it ever had or ever would again. In the aftermath of the war, almost every government in Europe, even Germany, was a republican democracy based on the rule of law. Even socialists had cause to celebrate: there was a nominally Marxist state in Russia and socialist parties were powerful and militant all across Europe. The old order of monarchs and nobles was rendered all but obsolete, with noble titles holding on as nothing more than archaic holdovers from the past in nearly every country. In addition, of course, technology continued to advance apace.Despite the success of all of those movements, however, with all of the hopes and aspirations of their supporters over the last century, Europe had degenerated into a horrendous and costly war. The war had not purified and invigorated the great powers; they were all left reeling, weakened, and at a loss for how to prevent a future war. Science had advanced, but it seemed as if its most noteworthy accomplishment was the production of more effective weapons. The global empires remained, but the seeds of their dissolution were already present.The results were bitterness and reprisals. The Treaty of Versailles that ended the war imposed harsh penalties on Germany, returning Alsace and Lorraine to France and imposing a massive indemnity on the defeated country. The Treaty also required Germany to accept the war guilt clause, in which it assumed full responsibility for the war having started in the first place. Simultaneously, the Austrian Empire collapsed, with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the new Balkan nation of Yugoslavia all becoming independent countries and Austria a short-lived republic. Almost no one would have believed that another Great War would occur in twenty years.In other words, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"401-VIII - Summary Results of WWI - Seminal Catastrophe > Results of World War I\" data-href=\"401-VIII - Summary Results of WWI - Seminal Catastrophe#Results of World War I\" href=\"401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-viii-summary-results-of-wwi-seminal-catastrophe.html#Results of World War I\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">World War I did not resolve any of the problems or international tensions that had started it</a>. Instead, it made them worse because it proved how powerful and devastating modern weapons were, and it also demonstrated that no single power was likely to be able to assert its dominance. France and Britain went out of their way in blaming Germany for the conflict, while in Germany itself, those on the right believed in the conspiracy theory in which communists and Jews had conspired to sabotage the German war effort – this was later called the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"401-II - The Peace Treaties > Dolchstosslegende / Stab in the Back myth\" data-href=\"401-II - The Peace Treaties#Dolchstosslegende / Stab in the Back myth\" href=\"401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-ii-the-peace-treaties.html#Dolchstosslegende / Stab in the Back myth\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stab in the Back myth</a>. Thus, many Germans felt they had been wronged twice: they had not “really” lost the war, yet they were forced to pay outrageous indemnities to the “victors.”It was in this context of anger and disappointment that fascism and its racially-obsessed offshoot Nazism arose. World War I provided the trauma, the bloodshed, and the skepticism toward liberalism and socialism that underwrote the rise of fascism. Fascism was a modern conservatism, a conservatism that clung to its mania for order and hierarchy, but which did not seek a return to the days of feudalism and monarchy. It was a populist movement, a movement of the people by the people, but instead of petty democratic bickering, it glorified the (imagined) nation, a nation united by a movement and an ethos.<br>→ <a data-href=\"402-II The Rise of Fascism\" href=\"402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">402-II The Rise of Fascism</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Rise of Authoritarian and Totalitarian States","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_Authoritarian_and_Totalitarian_States_0"},{"heading":"Context of Fascism","level":2,"id":"Context_of_Fascism_0"}],"links":["401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-viii-summary-results-of-wwi-seminal-catastrophe.html#Results of World War I","401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-ii-the-peace-treaties.html#Dolchstosslegende / Stab in the Back myth","402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756282027939,"modifiedTime":1756448032737,"sourceSize":4668,"sourcePath":"402 Totalitarianism/402-I Failing of Democracy.md","exportPath":"402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":30,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html":{"title":"402-II The Rise of Fascism","icon":"","description":"Comprehension and beyond Name and define the elements of fascism\nIn what way do these elements oppose liberalism, parliamentarianism, and democracy?\nWhat do you think it takes for single-party systems to be established in a state?\nWhere do you see dangers of something like this happening in today’s democracies?

Symbolically, the sticks are weak individually but strong as a group, and the axe represented the power over life and death. In ancient Rome, the bodyguards of the Roman consuls carried the fasces as a badge of authority over war, peace, law, and death, and that symbolism appealed to the Italian Fascists.<br>By the early 1920s, there were fascist movements in many European countries, all of them agitating for some kind of right-wing revolution against democracy and socialism. One place of particular note in the early history of fascism was France. There, a right-wing monarchist group called Actione Française had existed since the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Dreyfus-affair\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Dreyfus-affair\" target=\"_self\">Dreyfus Affair</a>, but it transformed itself into a French fascist group despite still clinging to monarchist and traditional Catholic ideologies. When Germany defeated France in World War I, the Nazis found a large contingent of right-wing Frenchmen who were all too happy to create a home-grown French fascist state (a fact that many in France tried their best to forget after the war). Likewise, when the Nazis seized power in various places in Eastern Europe, they often found it expedient to simply work with or appoint the already-existing local fascist groups to power.Fascism was a twentieth-century phenomenon, but its ideological roots were firmly planted in the nineteenth century. Mostly obviously, fascism was an extreme form of nationalism. The nation was not just the home of a “people” in fascism, it was everything. The nation became a mythic entity that had existed since the ancient past, and fascists claimed that the cultural traits and patterns of the nation defined who a person was and how they regarded the world.The confusing jumble of what defined a nation in the first place often took on explicitly racial, and racist, terms among fascist groups. Now, Germans were not just people who spoke German in Central Europe; they were the German (or “Aryan,” the term itself nothing more than a pseudo-scholarly jumble of linguistic history and racist nonsense) “race.” French fascists talked about the bloodlines of the ancient Gauls that supposedly survived despite the “pollution” of the Roman invasions in the ancient past. Likewise, Mussolini and the Italian Fascists claimed that “the Italians” were the direct descendants of the most glorious tradition of the ancient Roman Empire and were destined to create a new, even greater empire. The pseudo-sciences of race had arisen in the late nineteenth century as perverse offshoots of genuine advances in biology and the natural sciences. Fascism was, among other things, a cultural movement that found in “scientific” racism a profoundly compatible doctrine: the “scientific” proof in the rightness of the racial nation’s rise to power.At first sight, one surprising aspect of fascism was that many fascists were former communists – Benito Mussolini, the leader of the Italian Fascist Party, had been a prominent member of the Italian Communist Party before World War I. What fascism and communism had in common was a rejection of bourgeois parliamentary democracy. They both sought transcendent political and social orders that went beyond “mere” parliamentary compromise. The major difference between them was that fascists discovered in World War I that most people were not willing to die for their social class, but they were willing to die for their nation. Fascism was, in part, a kind of collective movement that substituted nationalism for the class war. All classes would be united in the nation, fascists believed, for the greater glory of the race and movement.As noted above, the very term “fascist” is a product of the first fascist group to seize control of a powerful country: the Italian Fascist Party. Italian Fascism was an invention of Italian army veterans. Most important among them was Benito Mussolini, a combat veteran who had welcomed the war as a cleansing, invigorating opportunity for Italy to grow into a more powerful nation. He was deeply disappointed by its lackluster aftermath. Italy, having joined with England and France against Germany and Austria in hopes of seizing territory from the Austrians, was given very little land after the war. Thus, to Mussolini and many other Italians, the war had been especially pointless.The Fascists, who started out with a mere 100 members in the northern Italian city of Milan, grew rapidly because of the incredible social turmoil in Italy in 1919 and 1920. Italy had a powerful communist movement, one that was inspired by and linked to the Soviet Union’s recent birth and the success of the communist revolution in Russia. After the war, a huge strike wave struck Italy and many poor Italians in the countryside seized land from the semi-feudal landlords who still dominated rural society. There was genuine concern among traditional conservatives, the church, business leaders, and the middle classes that Italy would undergo a communist revolution just as had occurred in Russia - at the time Russia was still in the midst of its civil war between the Red Bolsheviks and the anti-communist coalition known as the Whites. By 1920 the Reds were clearly winning.<br>Blackshirts\n<img src=\"https://www.focus.it/site_stored/imgs/0005/038/800px-march_on_rome.1020x680.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nMussolini with Camicie nere\nThe Fascists organized themselves into paramilitary units of thugs known as the Blackshirts (for their party-issued uniforms) and engaged in open street fighting against communists, breaking up strikes, attacking communist leaders, destroying communist newspaper offices, and intimidating voters from communist-leaning neighborhoods and communities. They were often tacitly aided by the police, who rounded up communists but ignored Fascist lawbreaking as long as it was directed against the communists. Likewise, business leaders started funding the Fascists as a kind of guarantee against further gains by communists. Fascist politicians ran for office in the Italian parliament while their gangs of thugs terrorized the opposition.\nIn 1922, the weak-willed King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele III, appointed Mussolini Prime Minister, seeing in Mussolini a bulwark against the threat of communism (and caving in to the growing strength of the Fascist Party). Fascists from all over Italy converged in a famous “March on Rome,” a highly staged piece of political theater meant to demonstrate Fascist unity and strength. Mussolini then set out to destroy Italian democracy from within. From 1922 to 1926 Mussolini and the Fascists manipulated the Italian parliament, intimidated political opponents or actually had them murdered, and succeeded finally in eliminating party politics and a free press. The Fascist party became the only legal party in Italy and the police apparatus expanded dramatically. Mussolini’s official title was Il Duce: The Leader, and his authority over every political decision was absolute. The Fascist motto was “believe, obey, fight,” a distant parody of the French liberal motto (from the French Revolution) “liberty, equality, fraternity.”<br>Mass spectacle\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Naples_Fascist_rally_on_24_October_1922_%282%29.jpg/1102px-Naples_Fascist_rally_on_24_October_1922_%282%29.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br>\nDuring the March on Rome, 1922\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Parata_Camice_Nere_in_Corso_Libert%C3%A0_a_Bolzano.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nParade in 1930\nMussolini immediately understood the importance of appearances. The 1920s was the early age of mass media, especially radio, and an intrinsic part of fascism was public spectacle. Mussolini staged enormous public exhibitions and rallies and he carefully controlled how he was portrayed in the media – the press was forbidden to mention his age or his birthday, to give the illusion that he never aged. He was always on the move, usually in a race car, and usually accompanied by models, actresses, and socialites years his junior. He spoke about his own animal magnetism and often walked around without a shirt on as a kind of (would be) herculean archetype.\nOfficially, Italian Fascism promised to end the class conflict that lay at the heart of socialist ideology by favoring what it called “corporatism” over mere capitalism. Corporatism was supposed to be a unified decision-making system in which workers and business owners would serve on joint committees to control work. In fact, the owners derived all of the benefits; trade unions were banned and the plight of workers degenerated without representation.What Italian Fascism did do for the Italian people was essentially ideological and, in a sense, emotional: it directed youth movements and recreational clubs and sought the involvement of all Italians. It glorified the idea of the Italian people and in turn many actual Italians did come to feel great national pride, even if they were working in difficult conditions in a stagnant economy. In turn, Fascist propaganda tried to inculcate Italian pride and Fascist identity among Italian citizens, while Fascist-led police forces targeted would-be dissidents, sentencing thousands to prison terms or internal exile in closed prison villages (not unlike some of the Russian gulags that would exemplify a different but related totalitarian system to the east).While Mussolini was often praised in the foreign press, including in American newspapers and magazines, for accomplishments like making (a few) Italian trains run on time, in the long term the Fascist government proved to be inefficient and often outright ineffectual. Mussolini himself, convinced of his own genius, made arbitrary and often foolish decisions, especially when it came to building up and training the Italian military. The circle of Fascist leaders around him were largely corrupt sycophants who lied to Mussolini about Italy’s strength and prosperity to keep him happy. When World War II began in 1939, the Italian forces were revealed to be poorly trained, equipped, and led.<br><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Lincoln_Memorial_%28Lincoln_contrasty%29.jpg/960px-Lincoln_Memorial_%28Lincoln_contrasty%29.jpg?uselang=de\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg/500px-Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg.png\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br><img alt=\"402-dublone bern fasces.png\" src=\"resources/402-dublone-bern-fasces.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Coat_of_arms_of_canton_of_St._Gallen.svg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Swastika\nSwastika (Sanskrit, lit. “it is good”)\nused for at least 6000 years all over Afro-Eurasia:\nIndus-Valley cultures, Greco-Roman cultures, Germanic and Norse cultures, etc.<br>\n<img alt=\"402-bronze age jar with swastika.png\" src=\"resources/402-bronze-age-jar-with-swastika.png\" target=\"_self\">\nBronze age jar with Swastika, Asia Minor, Yortan culture or related in Western Anatolia, Early Bronze Age, ca. 2700 to 2300 BCE (source: Artemis Gallery, auction house, 2017)<br>\n<img alt=\"402-antique swastika.png\" src=\"resources/402-antique-swastika.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAsia Minor, Yortan culture or related in Western Anatolia, Early Bronze Age, ca. 2700 to 2300 BCE (source: Artemis Gallery, auction house, 2017)\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Fascism","level":2,"id":"Fascism_0"},{"heading":"Fascism in Italy","level":2,"id":"Fascism_in_Italy_0"},{"heading":"Rise of Fascism","level":2,"id":"Rise_of_Fascism_0"},{"heading":"Generating D2 diagram...","level":12,"id":"Generating_D2_diagram..._0"},{"heading":"From the World of Symbols","level":2,"id":"From_the_World_of_Symbols_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://cdn.britannica.com/24/107524-050-DD0AD2D1/Fasces.jpg","fullURL":"402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["resources/402-dublone-bern-fasces.html","resources/402-bronze-age-jar-with-swastika.html","resources/402-antique-swastika.html"],"createdTime":1756218421240,"modifiedTime":1756710911465,"sourceSize":13945,"sourcePath":"402 Totalitarianism/402-II The Rise of Fascism.md","exportPath":"402-totalitarianism/402-ii-the-rise-of-fascism.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":31,"backlinks":["401-interwar-period-and-totalitarianism/401-vi-interwar-society.html","402-totalitarianism/402-i-failing-of-democracy.html"],"type":"markdown"},"402-totalitarianism/402-iii-totalitarianism.html":{"title":"402-III Totalitarianism","icon":"","description":" Define totalitarian state for the early 20th century.\nHow did Mussolini and the Fascists try to make their state a totalitarian one?

Alphabeta → alphabet\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Phoenician_alphabet.svg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nPhoenician alphabet\nThe letters of the Phoenician alphabet, the earliest alphabetic system (end of 2nd millenium BC). Variations of this system spread into all kinds of regions and these simpler scripts were more widely used, if by an elite minority, though.\nThe Greeks, who called themselves Hellenes from the 8th century onwards, did not form a homogenous political nation. They consisted of several tribes and independent city-states (poleis, singular: polis). Nonetheless, the Greeks had a shared identity. They talked the same language, albeit in different dialects, and used the same alphabet inherited from the Phoenicians, a tradespeople from the eastern Mediterranean.Apart from that, the Greeks were unified by their religious beliefs. Greek religion was polytheistic, i.e., there were several gods. Although they were immortal and enjoyed eternal youth, they had strong human features and acted like mortals. According to the Greek belief system, the gods lived on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, as a family. Their leaders were Zeus and his wife Hera. The Olympian gods (see Pantheon, below), all relatives of them, had different fields of duties: Apollo (healing, fortune-telling, poetry), Aphrodi­te (love), Artemis (hunt), Ares (war), Poseidon (the sea), Hermes (messenger of the gods, god of the travellers, merchants and thieves). In order to get the god’s help, they had to be appeased with sacrifices. These adoration ceremonies took place outside the temples. Some sanctuaries became very famous. In Olympia, Greeks from various states met since 776 BC to compete in sports in honour of Zeus. In Delphi, the Greeks consulted with the oracle of Apollo and also took part in games in his honour.Antique Pantheon <br>Art on pottery\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg/960px-Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nRunners, c. 500 BC, Louvre\nOne of the characteristics of the visual arts was their uniformity throughout the numerous city-states. Until Hellenistic times, it was mostly communities who ordered pieces of art, so they were basically made for the public and for religious purposes (e.g. the Acropolis). Along vase painters, sculptors were very skilful. In classical times they managed to create vivid, lively sculptures which they integrated into buildings (temples, effigies, palaces). The first sculptural portraits were also made by Greek sculptors.The literary and artistic achievements of the Greeks were a major influence for occidental culture. The two epics of the destruction of Troy (Iliad) and Ulysses’ Odyssey by Homer determined the Greeks’ picture of their gods and historical origins. Myths and sagas initially formed the major parts of Greek historiography, too. Then, Herodot (~485 until after 430) and Thukydides (~460 until ~400) introduced a new way of historical thinking. Both historians were keen on writing truthfully about contemporary events and on showing the roots of important events. Tragedy and comedy developed out of cultic performances in honour of the gods.Initially, Greek philosophers were learned, wise men (e.g. Pythagoras, Thales), who tried to explain the world on a rational basis using different disciplines (e.g. ethics, mathematics, physics, music, poetry). Socrates (469 – 399) opposed the sophists, for whom man was the measure of all things. He looked for a base of the universe which was objective, outside human influence. He also looked for standards for human knowledge and for moral conducts. Plato (427 – 347) wrote Socrates’ teachings down in the form of dialogues. He himself thought about the ideal political state, which ought to be in harmony with human nature and the immortality of the human soul. Plato assumed that besides the ever-changing world, there are unchangeable archetypes (original forms) of all things, which man can only grasp through his thinking: ideas. Plato’s most influential student was Aristotle (384 – 322). He collected the whole knowledge of his time, and, by putting it into a clear, disctinct order, developed significant criteria for scientific work.(Adapted from Grundwissen Geschichte, tr.

valley and a few other regions, societies emerged that were far larger and denser than the farming communities of the Neolithic period. We refer to these big concentrations of people as complex societies, or, more traditionally, as civilisations.\nTheir most noticeable characteristic was cities. Early cities were centres of power, manufacturing, and creativity. Building and preserving them, however, required drastic alterations of the local environment to produce sufficient food, building materials, and sources of energy. The price of this intervention was high. Dense urban societies were extremely vulnerable to changes in weather, climate, disease conditions, wood supplies, and trade links to distant regions. After the appearance of complex societies, humans stepped up their efforts to manipulate and control their physical and natural environment. This had great benefits but also produced a negative feedback cycle.Dates\nAmong the oldest cities are\n• Jericho (fortified ~8000)\n• Çatal Hüyük (~7000)\n•Ur (~5000)\n• Byblos (5th millennium)\n~5700\nFirst proto-urban\narchitecture in Egypt\n~5500\nNeolithical settlements with long houses in Middle Europe\n~4600\nFirst city-like settlements in the Indus valley\n~4300 to ~800 BC\nStilt house settlements in central Europe\n~3800\nCultures in China\norganized in cities\n~3300\nGlacier man “Ötzi”\n~3100 to ~2600\nStonehenge\n~3000\nSumerian city-states\n~2600 – 1800\nMohenjo-Daro in the Indus valley, systematically planned city\nThe intensification of population and production obliged humans to experiment with new forms of social organization. The customs and rules that governed social relationships in a foraging band of twentyfive or thirty people were no longer adequate.<br>After about 4000 BC, massive changes occur in social customs and institutions. The complex societies that arose in the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Indus valleys, and somewhat later in other regions, were cauldrons<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> of intensification. That is, people lived and worked together in much larger, denser communities than had ever existed. These societies shared a number of fundamental characteristics, which we generally associate with civilizations:\nCities arose, the early ones varying somewhat in their forms and functions. By 2250 BC, there were about eight cities in the world that had 30 000 or more inhabitants. By 1200 BC there were about sixteen cities that big.\n<br>Some people took up full-time specialized occupations and professions (artisans<a data-footref=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, merchants<a data-footref=\"3\" href=\"#fn-3-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, soldiers, priests, and so on) rather than spending most of their time collecting, producing, or processing food.\nA hierarchy of social classes (social stratification) appeared in which some men and women – the elite class – had more wealth, power, and privilege than did others. Also, men became dominant over women in political and social life, leading to patriarchy.\nThe state, that is, a centralized system of government and command, was invented. This meant that a minority group – kings, queens, high officials, priests, generals – exercised control over the labour and social behaviour of everyone else.\nComplex exchanges of food and other products took place within the complex society, and lines of trade connected the society to neighbours near and far.\nTechnological innovations multiplied, and each new useful invention tended to suggest several others.\nMonumental building took place – city walls, temples, palaces, public plazas, and tombs of rulers.\nA system of writing, or at least a complex method of record-keeping, came into use.\nSpiritual belief systems, public laws, and artistic expressions all became richer and more complex.\nCreative individuals collaborated with the ruling class to lay the foundations of astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry, as well as civil engineering and architecture.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\" target=\"_self\">Cuneiform</a>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sales_contract_Shuruppak_Louvre_AO3766.jpg/960px-Sales_contract_Shuruppak_Louvre_AO3766.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nA contract for the sale of a field and a house, in the wedge-shaped cuneiform adapted for clay tablets, Shuruppak, c. 2600 BC\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs\" target=\"_self\">Hieroglyphs</a>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Minnakht_01.JPG/960px-Minnakht_01.JPG\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nHieroglyphs on a “stela” now kept in the Louvre, Paris, c. 1321 BC.\n<br>Dates\n(<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"03 Antiquity Timelines > Ancient Civilizations\" data-href=\"03 Antiquity Timelines#Ancient Civilizations\" href=\"002-timelines/03-antiquity-timelines.html#Ancient Civilizations\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">see as timeline</a>)\n~3000\nParallel development of cuneiform in Mesopotamia and hieroglyphs in Egypt\n~2980\nFirst unification of Upper and Lower Egypt (Old Kingdom)\n~2650 – 2190\nTime of the Pyramids\n~2650 First step pyramid by Snofru\n~2600 Cheops pyramid\n2600 – ~1425\nMinoan culture on Crete\n~1900 – 1531\nBabylonian Empire\n~1700\nCode of Hammurabi, earliest known law code\n~1600\nMycenaean Culture,\nearliest advanced civilization on mainland Europe\n~1000 – 70 BC\nKingdom of Israel (with interruptions)\n30 BC\nDeath of the last pharaoh, Cleopatra VII.\nEgypt becomes a Roman province\n<br>A society did not have to have every one of these characteristics to qualify as a civilization. The checklist is less important than the fact that all these social, cultural, economic, and political elements interacted dynamically with one another. The synergism<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> among them made the society complex, that is, made it recognizable as a civilization.World population started growing at a faster rate than ever before. The size and density of communities expanded, and networks of communication by land and sea became more extensive and sophisticated. Along with these developments came, as we might well expect, an intensification in the flow of information and a general speed-up in the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds.<br>\nOne example is religious knowledge. In the early millennia of this period certain ideas, practices, and artistic expressions centred on the worship of female deities<a data-footref=\"5\" href=\"#fn-5-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> spread widely along routes of trade and migration to embrace a large part of western Eurasia. Another example is the idea and technology of writing, which emerged first, as far as we know, in either Egypt or Mesopotamia and spread widely from there to the eastern Mediterranean and India. A third example is the horse-drawn chariot, which may have first appeared in the Inner Eurasian steppes and within less than a thousand years spread all across Eurasia from western Europe to China.<br>There were numerous scientific, technological, and cultural innovations that complex societies achieved. To take just one early example, the city-dwellers of Sumer in southern Mesopotamia, which is as far as we know the earliest urban civilization, made fundamental scientific and technical breakthroughs in the fourth and third millennia BC. Sometime before 3000 BC, Sumerian scribes worked out a system of numerical notation in the writing script they used, called cuneiform. They used a combination of base-ten and base-sixty mathematics, together with a growing understanding of geometry, for everyday government and commerce, as well as to survey land, chart the stars, design buildings, and build irrigation<a data-footref=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[6]</a> works. Other technical innovations included the seed drill (a sowing device), the vaulted arch, refinements in bronze metallurgy, and, most ingenious of all, the wheel. This concept was probably first applied to pottery making, later to transport and ploughing.<br>Within complex societies, such as those that emerged in the great river valleys, the interchange of information and ideas tended to be so intense that each society developed a distinct cultural style. We can tell apart these distinctive styles today in the surviving remnants<a data-footref=\"7\" href=\"#fn-7-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[7]</a> of buildings, art objects, written texts, tools, and other material remains.\nWe should, however, keep two ideas in mind. One is that all complex societies were invariably changing, rather than possessing timeless, static cultural traits. The style of a civilization changed from one generation to the next because cultural expressions and values were invariably bound up with the natural environment, economic life, and politics, which were continuously changing as well. The second point is that early civilizations were not culturally self-contained. All of them developed and changed as they did partly because of their connections to other societies near and far, connections that played themselves out in trade, migration, war, and cultural exchange. |<br><img src=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/img/r/p/1500x1500/17844.png.webp?v=1737009437-1695055322\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"> <br>Cauldron: a big pot to boil e.g. soup in.<a href=\"#fnref-1-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Someone who does skilled work with their hands.<a href=\"#fnref-2-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>People who trade in goods.<a href=\"#fnref-3-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Synergism: when two or more factors work together in a positive way.<a href=\"#fnref-4-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Gods and godesses<a href=\"#fnref-5-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Bringing water to otherwise dry land.<a href=\"#fnref-6-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Remnant: something (or a part of the original) which is left over<a href=\"#fnref-7-c7cac157f529d058\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Crowded Cities","level":2,"id":"Crowded_Cities_0"},{"heading":"Social Consequences","level":3,"id":"Social_Consequences_0"},{"heading":"Early complex societies","level":4,"id":"Early_complex_societies_0"},{"heading":"Ideas","level":2,"id":"Ideas_0"},{"heading":"Complex societies as centres of innovation","level":3,"id":"Complex_societies_as_centres_of_innovation_0"},{"heading":"Different cultural styles","level":3,"id":"Different_cultural_styles_0"}],"links":["002-timelines/03-antiquity-timelines.html#Ancient Civilizations"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://cdn.britannica.com/08/150008-050-D5A45539/Ziggurat-Ur.jpg","fullURL":"103-early-civilisations/103-i-cities-and-civilisations.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755007384842,"modifiedTime":1756709645720,"sourceSize":9762,"sourcePath":"103 Early Civilisations/103-I - Cities and Civilisations.md","exportPath":"103-early-civilisations/103-i-cities-and-civilisations.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":15,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"103-early-civilisations/103-ii-illustrating-features-of-early-civilisations.html":{"title":"103-II - Illustrating Features of Early Civilisations","icon":"","description":"Info\nThe pictures you find here are all from freely available online sources.

class=\"is-unresolved\">\nUnteruhldingen, Lake Constance, Germany. Reconstruction.\nThe so-called lake dwellings (Uferrandsiedlungen), or stilt houses (Pfahlbauten), are still to be located all along the arch of the Alps. They form a network, connecting parts of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Lake dwellings were built at the shores of lakes, using oak or ash stems that were rammed into the moist or wet ground. These stilts were found in the 19th century and the thesis was that the bronze age people who built them had rammed the stilts into the lake bed and then platforms were built onto the lake. This thesis cannot be fully supported by later finds. For instance, there were many stilts rammed into the ground one by the other, but they turned out not to be from the same time. This suggests that replacements had to be made time and again, probably because at the place where the stilt came out of the ground and into contact with the air, it would rot relatively quickly, while the part in the ground which was sealed off from oxygen stayed intact. Of course, high waters would still have flooded the area of the houses.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/007857/2019-04-03/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/007857/2019-04-03/\" target=\"_self\"><em></em> this article</a>Skim on lake dwellings in the Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz.
