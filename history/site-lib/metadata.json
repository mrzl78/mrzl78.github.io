course by Marcel Röthlisberger, Gymnasium Lerbermatt, Switzerland.\nThis website is for internal use at Gymnasium in classes held by Marcel Röthlisberger. Sources are provided. No copyright infringement is intended.Everything that is now, is something that has become. Freely after André Holenstein: «Das Seiende als etwas Gewordenes verstehen»\nThis course runs over the 4 years of Gymnasium and provides a chronological overview of mostly Western aspects, with an open mind to international, non-European aspects, especially colonialism and decolonisation. We are Europeans based in Europe. An understanding of European culture, politics, History, society, languages and customs is essential for students who live and mature here. It is equally important, though, for all Europeans, to have a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of Europe and Europeans with the Earth and European societies’ responsibility for their actions in the past and their consequences.\nOur students are on the brink of becoming fully entitled members of our democratic society. They shall have the tools to understand dependencies, meaning of text and speech, culture and customs, political processes and possibilities. Not least, they shall understand that change is possible, necessary, and inevitable.“The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” LP Hartley, The Go-Between\nBy looking at the other, people become aware of the self. A deeper understanding of other possibilities of living a human’s life is essential. The humanities – History among them, but also literature and cultural studies – offer tools and insight into other people’s minds and living conditions. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01%20Geschichte/Spielvogel%20-%20Western%20Civilization%2010th%20ed%20Vol%202?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=9ysXKf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01 Geschichte/Spielvogel - Western Civilization 10th ed Vol 2?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=9ysXKf\" target=\"_self\">Spielvogel chapters</a> (restricted access from within the school)Text sources under public domain:<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/698\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/698\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 1</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/699\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/699\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 2</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/700\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/700\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Brooks, Western Civilization: A Concise History, Volume 3</a>Marcel Röthlisberger\nGymnasium Lerbermatt\n©MMXXV","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"About the History course","level":2,"id":"About_the_History_course_0"},{"heading":"Resources","level":2,"id":"Resources_0"}],"links":["!https://lerbermatt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/marcel_roethlisberger_lerbermatt_ch/Documents/Material/01%20Geschichte/Spielvogel%20-%20Western%20Civilization%2010th%20ed%20Vol%202?csf=1&web=1&e=9ysXKf"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"index.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753956249262,"modifiedTime":1760597481936,"sourceSize":2514,"sourcePath":"index.md","exportPath":"index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":85,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html":{"title":"104 Greece-End_of_Bronze_Age-Dialect_Displacement","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.jpg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html"],"createdTime":1756890243302,"modifiedTime":1756890243302,"sourceSize":438982,"sourcePath":"resources/104 Greece-End_of_Bronze_Age-Dialect_Displacement.jpg","exportPath":"resources/104-greece-end_of_bronze_age-dialect_displacement.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":50,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html":{"title":"104 greekdialects800bcs","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.jpg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html"],"createdTime":1756890316024,"modifiedTime":1756890316025,"sourceSize":462395,"sourcePath":"resources/104 greekdialects800bcs.jpg","exportPath":"resources/104-greekdialects800bcs.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":52,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"100-year1/104-ancient-greece/104-i-ancient-greece-–-overview.html":{"title":"104-I - Ancient Greece – Overview","icon":"","description":"Overview text Take notes of the most important aspects mentioned in the text.\nWhy is Greek culture still relevant today?

Variations of this system spread into all kinds of regions and these simpler scripts were more widely used, if by an elite minority, though.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251028065106.png\" src=\"100-year1/104-ancient-greece/attachments/pasted-image-20251028065106.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFirst letter: Alpha, coming from “Aleph” (West Semitic word for “ox”)\nThe Greeks, who called themselves Hellenes from the 8th century onwards, did not form a homogenous political nation. They consisted of several tribes and independent city-states (poleis, singular: polis). Nonetheless, the Greeks had a shared identity. They talked the same language, albeit in different dialects, and used the same alphabet inherited from the Phoenicians, a tradespeople from the eastern Mediterranean.Apart from that, the Greeks were unified by their religious beliefs. Greek religion was polytheistic, i.e., there were several gods. Although they were immortal and enjoyed eternal youth, they had strong human features and acted like mortals. According to the Greek belief system, the gods lived on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, as a family. Their leaders were Zeus and his wife Hera. The Olympian gods (see Pantheon, below), all relatives of them, had different fields of duties: Apollo (healing, fortune-telling, poetry), Aphrodi­te (love), Artemis (hunt), Ares (war), Poseidon (the sea), Hermes (messenger of the gods, god of the travellers, merchants and thieves). In order to get the god’s help, they had to be appeased with sacrifices. These adoration ceremonies took place outside the temples. Some sanctuaries became very famous. In Olympia, Greeks from various states met since 776 BC to compete in sports in honour of Zeus. In Delphi, the Greeks consulted with the oracle of Apollo and also took part in games in his honour.Antique Pantheon <br>Art on pottery\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg/960px-Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">\nRunners, c. 500 BC, Louvre\nOne of the characteristics of the visual arts was their uniformity throughout the numerous city-states. Until Hellenistic times, it was mostly communities who ordered pieces of art, so they were basically made for the public and for religious purposes (e.g. the Acropolis). Along vase painters, sculptors were very skilful. In classical times they managed to create vivid, lively sculptures which they integrated into buildings (temples, effigies, palaces). The first sculptural portraits were also made by Greek sculptors.The literary and artistic achievements of the Greeks were a major influence for occidental culture. The two epics of the destruction of Troy (Iliad) and Ulysses’ Odyssey by Homer determined the Greeks’ picture of their gods and historical origins. Myths and sagas initially formed the major parts of Greek historiography, too. Then, Herodot (~485 until after 430) and Thukydides (~460 until ~400) introduced a new way of historical thinking. Both historians were keen on writing truthfully about contemporary events and on showing the roots of important events. Tragedy and comedy developed out of cultic performances in honour of the gods.Initially, Greek philosophers were learned, wise men (e.g. Pythagoras, Thales), who tried to explain the world on a rational basis using different disciplines (e.g. ethics, mathematics, physics, music, poetry). Socrates (469 – 399) opposed the sophists, for whom man was the measure of all things. He looked for a base of the universe which was objective, outside human influence. He also looked for standards for human knowledge and for moral conducts. Plato (427 – 347) wrote Socrates’ teachings down in the form of dialogues. He himself thought about the ideal political state, which ought to be in harmony with human nature and the immortality of the human soul. Plato assumed that besides the ever-changing world, there are unchangeable archetypes (original forms) of all things, which man can only grasp through his thinking: ideas. Plato’s most influential student was Aristotle (384 – 322). He collected the whole knowledge of his time, and, by putting it into a clear, disctinct order, developed significant criteria for scientific work.(Adapted from Grundwissen Geschichte, tr.
